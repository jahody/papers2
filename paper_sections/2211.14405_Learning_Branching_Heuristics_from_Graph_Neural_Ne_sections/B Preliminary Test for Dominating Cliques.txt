To check whether Equation (5) works effectively as the loss function of the GNN model for finding dominating cliques, we create other \(G(n,p)\) instances with different \(n\) and \(p\) . In particular, \(n\) ranges from 25 to 400 in increments of 25, and \(p\) ranges from 0.1 to 0.9 in increments of 0.2, so we have 80 pairs of \(n\) and \(p\) . Then we generate 32 instances from \(G(n,p)\) for each pair of \(n\) and \(p\) and check the values of loss function of these instances output from the well- trained probabilistic- method GNN model. From the above phase transition, the instances generated from \(G(n,p)\) where \(p = 0.1\) have low likelihood of containing a dominating clique; on the contrary, the instances generated from \(G(n,p)\) where \(p = 0.9\) are more likely to have dominating cliques. Figure 3 shows the average of the values of loss function of the 32 instances for each pair of \(n\) and \(p\) . From Figure 3, we can see that the average of the values of loss function of the instances generated from \(G(n,p)\) where \(p = 0.1\) are much greater than the corresponding average of the instances generated from \(G(n,p)\) where \(p = 0.9\) , which is consistent with the known phase transition because the greater loss- function values imply the lower probabilities of existing a dominating clique.
