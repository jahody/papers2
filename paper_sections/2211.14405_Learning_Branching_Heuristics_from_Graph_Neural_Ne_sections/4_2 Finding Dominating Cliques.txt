We run experiments on three dominating- clique solvers: the original solver in [9] and the GNN- enhanced solvers (the output distributions from the GNN model with the loss function (5) as input) using the fast and accurate calculations of joint information entropy respectively.
Table 1: Results on test dataset: approximation ratios on real-world datasets and \(G(n,p)\) instances; the average number of nodes of \(G(n,p)\) instances is similar to the average number of nodes of graphs in Twitter (about 120 nodes per graph); Sparse means that the instances are generated with \(0.2\leq p\leq 0.4\) ; Dense means that the instances are generated with \(0.6\leq p\leq 0.8\) ; italics indicates the standard deviation.

Figure 1 shows the experimental results on test data. To be specific, Figure 1a shows the winning ratios of the three solvers on the instances that dominating cliques do not exist, and Figure 1c shows the winning ratios of the three solvers on the instances that dominating cliques exist. Figure 1b shows the ratios of the GNN- enhanced solvers to the original algorithm in terms of geometric
average number \(^2\) of their branches on the instances that dominating cliques do not exist. Figure 1d shows such ratios on the instances that dominating cliques exist. It is reasonable that the GNN- enhanced solvers perform better on the instances that dominating cliques do not exist. For such case, solvers go through the whole search tree, so the learned branching heuristic can prune more search space. Instead, for the case of solving instances that dominating cliques exist, the original heuristic might be equally effective since solvers return once a dominating clique is found.
