We implement our GNN model by PyTorch 1.9.1 and PyTorch Geometric 2.0.1. We set the node features of an input graph as 1- dimensional vectors. As shown above, we interpret these features as the Bernoulli distributions associated with vertices. Our GNN model consists of 8 layers: 6 graph- isomorphism- network (GIN) layers and 2 linear layers followed. The reason of using GINs is that the properties of sub- structures of the graphs containing dominating cliques are similar. For example, the diameters of the graphs containing dominating cliques are at most 3, and they all have a clique as a kernel. GIN is a good option here because it has the most powerful ability in GNN layers to detect isomorphic subgraphs [14]. We apply the batch normalization on the output of each layer as it is a standard operation in GNNs, see [15]. In addition, we set the batch size as 32 because this number has a good practice in real applications [16]. Furthermore, our dominating- clique solvers are implemented by the programming language C and run on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS with Intel CPU i7- 11700F and 48GB RAM.
