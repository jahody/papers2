We use a weighted GCN (W GCN) [Zhao et al., 2021] as our first network to extract features of variables and a multi- layer perceptron (MLP) to output the possibility of variables presented in UNSAT- core. The W GCN can perfectly match the design of WLIG to utilize the edge weight and enhance the message exchange.  

The W GCN accepts the adjacency matrix as input to build the graph structure. Apart from that, to address features of literals, we initialize the embedding for a literal node with vector \(h \in \mathbf{R}^{2d}\) . The vector \(h\) is produced by concatenating the degree of node \(D \in \mathbf{R}\) and the literal type of node \(T \in \mathbf{R}\) vertically and then feeding to a linear transformation \(L_{init}\) : \(\mathbf{R}^{1 \times 2} \to \mathbf{R}^{1 \times 2d}\) to produce sparse node embedding.  

\[h_{i} = L_{init}(D_{i} \oplus T_{i}), H = [h_{1}, h_{2}, \ldots , h_{N}]^{T} \quad (1)\]  

The node embedding vectors \(H\) will be updated by aggregating embedding from its neighbors during each iteration of W GCN. Namely, a single iteration can be represented:  

\[H^{(l + 1)} = \mathrm{ReLU}(L_{out}(A'H^{(l)}\oplus \mathrm{Flip}(H^{(l)}))), \quad (2)\]  

where \(H^{(l)}\) represents the node features after the \(l\) - th iteration. We detail the computation process inside the W GCN unit as follows.

\(A'\) is the normalized adjacency matrix which encapsulates aggregation operations, and values in \(A'\) also carry weights to apply in the WGCN. \(A'\) is computed as follows to avoid gradient explosion:  

\[A' = \frac{A}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}\sum_{j = 1}^{N}A_{ij}}. \quad (3)\]  

Function \(F l i p\) and linear transformation \(L_{out}:\mathbf{R}^{1\times 4d}\to\) \(\mathbf{R}^{1\times 2d}\) concatenate features of literal nodes with the corresponding negated literal nodes, forming a comprehensive representation of variables.  

\[\mathrm{Flip}(H) = [h_{\frac{N}{2} +1},\ldots ,h_{N},h_{1},\ldots ,h_{\frac{N}{2}}]^{T} \quad (4)\]  

After \(L\) iterations of WGCN, we obtain the vectors representing structural information of literals, and feed it to MLP for the UNSAT- core possibility of each variable:  

\[p_{i} = \mathrm{softmax}(L_{2}\cdot \mathrm{ReLU}(L_{1}\cdot (h_{i}\oplus h_{N + 1 - i}) + b_{1}) + b_{2}) \quad (5)\]
