Against above backdrop, we propose a novel methodology for interaction with the CDCL solver. Before attempting to solve a SAT problem, our trained network undertakes an inferential analysis of the problem, thereby calculating the probability of each variable being within the UNSAT- core. These probabilities guide the solver in establishing a queue as well as a set of scores for solver branch decisions. Probabilities output are first used as the initialization for decision scores. Then they are employed to rank variables in descending queue, which is adopted as the initial value for decision queue. As predicted decision queue and decision score are based on the probability of variables within UNSAT- core, solver can deal with those variables that highly related to UNSAT- core first to address the unsatisfiability.  

These decision values and decision queue, now based on our neural network inference, are imported as the solver's initial values. The solver then can commence its operations on problem. This importing process doesn't undermine the solver's capacity to comprehensively address UNSAT problems, as the basic algorithm in place still centers around identifying the UNSAT- core.  

The added advantage here is that our inference performs only once for each problem, thus keeping the computational burden and associated time minimal. The processing time of the whole pipeline of IB- Net (including graph formulation, inference and solver initialization) can be controled within 1.5 second, which is regarded as a small cost comparing to the solving time. It's worth noting that our neural network is efficient enough to run on CPUs. Consequently, our method maintains the solver's completeness while significantly enhancing its efficiency and speed.
