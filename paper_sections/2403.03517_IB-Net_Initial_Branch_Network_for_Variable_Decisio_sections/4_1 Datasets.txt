We utilize two datasets to train and evaluate our framework and previous approaches. The first one is the industrial LEC circuit SAT instances from real- life chip design in 2023. They

are extracted from the real chip development process to reflect the need for LEC process. To fit the data into GPU easily and model the real- life production constraint, we first run state- of- the- art SAT solver (Kissat [Biere and Fleury, 2022]) on these problems and filter the instance that solver can solve within 1,000 seconds (the instances that solver cannot solve within 1,000 seconds will be regarded as hard cases and sent to redesign in real- life). Apart from the industrial dataset, we also prepare the SAT Competition dataset as previous works are mostly target open datasets. We adopt the anniversary track of SAT Competition in 2022 [Balyo et al., 2022]. The anniversary track is comprised of all benchmark instances used in previous SAT Competitions to ensure the coverage of problems. We also filter the anniversary track dataset in the same way with LEC dataset. The details of filtered datasets can be found in Table 1. Halted here means instances unsolved within given time. After preparing the datasets, we use Kissat and Drat- trim [Wetzler et al., 2014] to find variable assignments for SAT problems and UNSAT- core for UNSAT problems, which serves as the supervision of our model training. When Kissat try to solve a UNSAT instance, it will produce a proof for the unsatisfiability, which will be taken by Drat- trim to produce the UNSAT- core variable. Though the UNSAT- core found by Drat- trim is not the minimal core, it still helps in solving UNSAT instances, so we will take these UNSAT- core as all the UNSAT- core refered in following sections. The supervision production just cost the same time of solving given dataset by Kissat, which can consider as easy to follow and efficient to produce.
