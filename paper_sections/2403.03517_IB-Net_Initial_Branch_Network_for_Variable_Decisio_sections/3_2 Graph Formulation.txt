A propositional logic formula is a Boolean expression that contains conjunctions, disjunctions, variables, negations, and constants. The Boolean formula can be expressed in conjunctive normal form (CNF) with conjunction of disjunctions of variables (possibly negated variables) by transformation with linear length in linear time [Tseitin, 1983]. The SAT instance in CNF is a conjunction of clauses while a clause is a disjunction of literals (the variables and negated variables). The SAT instances are already converted into CNF before accessed by model and solvers, which is a common step when apply solvers.  

To make use of the structure information within the formula, we convert SAT instance S into WLIG G. But in WLIG, the literal set of S are nodes and the common incidence of literals are edges, i.e. \((l_{1}, l_{2})\) hold edge if \(l_{1}\) and \(l_{2}\) appear in the same clause and the weight on edge account for the number of common incidences. The adjacent matrix \(A\) of graph G will be the input to the graph model.
