To address our goal to assist the CDCL solvers targeting UNSAT problems, we propose the framework in Fig. 1. It is a combination of a neural network and a method to interact with solvers. For an input Boolean formula, it will firstly be converted into a Weighted Literal- Incidence Graph (WLIG) and fed into GNN for node feature updating, then gather the output as possibility to be UNSAT- core for variables. These output are assigned to SAT CDCL solver to initialize variable decision queue and decision score to guide the solving process. To make IB- Net more suitable for dealing with UNSAT problem, we made several improvement along the pipeline, which will be discussed in following subsections.
