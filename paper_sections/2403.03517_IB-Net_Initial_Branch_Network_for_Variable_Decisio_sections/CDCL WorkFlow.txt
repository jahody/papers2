The Conflict- Driven Clause Learning algorithm, a prevailing methodology used by modern SAT solvers, functions through a combination of decision- making, unit propagation, conflict analysis, and non- chronological backtracking.  

Fig. 2 provides a detailed workflow for the CDCL process. From Fig 2, it can be found that the algorithm begins with a decision- making process where Boolean values are assigned to variables according to a decision queue. This is succeeded by unit propagation, whereby necessary assignments of other variables are deduced based on the current partial assignment. Conflicts, however, can occur if a clause in the problem becomes unsatisfiable with these assignments. In response to conflicts, the CDCL flow initiates a conflict analysis, learning and adding a new clause representing the conflict reason to the problem to avoid repetition of the same error in fu
ture iterations. The CDCL algorithm concludes with nonchronological backtracking/backjumping, which does not merely revert the most recent decision but backjumps to a point preceding the conflict, result in assigning a lower place in the decision- making queue or a lower decision- score to these variables involved in conflict. This allows a more rapid exploration of different solution spaces and aids in the avoidance of past mistakes. Two critical stages of this process are conflict analysis (clause learning) and variable decision, which collaboratively construct the decision queue for variable branching. Ideally, a swift identification of variables within the UNSAT- core would expedite the CDCL solver's resolution of UNSAT problems. Conversely, prematurely including variables outside UNSAT- core within the decision queue could slow down the solver. Thus we should try to guide the decision queue to optimize the performance. Specifically, we would instruct the decision queue and decision score, the internal variable used within variable decision and conflict analysis.
