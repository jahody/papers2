In previous approaches, Literal- Clause Graph construction is applied as the common way to set both literal and clause as node and affiliation between clause and literal as edge. The change from LCG to WLIG give up the useless clause information in UNSAT- core prediction and focus more on literal connection.
Through experiments in Fig. 4(a), we conclude that the WLIG construction consistently outperforms Literal-Clause Graph commonly used in previous approaches, in terms of both accuracy and F1 scores targeting UNSAT problems and especially increase the performance on variables not in UNSAT- core. This evidence supports our decision to adopt WLIG for graph construction in our model.
