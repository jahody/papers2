To target the special UNSAT problem in LEC context, we amend the Cross- Entropy loss into focal loss. Upon analysis in Fig. 4(c), we find that the Focal loss delivers superior performance, outpacing both KLDiv and Cross- Entropy used in previous approaches and considered common choices in classification. This result justifies our adoption of Focal loss as the preferred loss function in the imbalance data distribution.
