In this paper, we presented a novel approach specifically tailored to the UNSAT problem solving in LEC process. Our approach, termed as IB- Net, introduces a GNN model to predict a decision strategy queue and decision scores, serving as a powerful assistant tool for CDCL SAT solvers.  

Our comprehensive set of experiments established the superiority of IB- Net in accelerating SAT solving, significantly outperforming existing methods. This performance gain is particularly pronounced within the context of LEC. Furthermore, our approach has demonstrated the capability to successfully solve instances that were previously deemed unsolvable using traditional SAT solvers.  

The impact of IB- Net extends beyond its immediate performance advantages. By combining machine learning techniques with traditional SAT solvers, the unique blend of these disciplines can enable more efficient and robust solvers. As we continue to refine and expand on our method, we envision a future where the performance gains offered by approaches like IB- Net become standard in the realm of SAT solving.
