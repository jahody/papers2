For evaluation metrics, we aim to evaluate: (1) the efficacy of UNSAT- core prediction for UNSAT problems on test datasets. (2) end- to- end time efficiency of models in interaction with Kissat solver, compared with the standalone performance of the original Kissat solver. We use evaluation metrics as: (1) A.RT means the average runtime among all CNFs. (2) Imp. means the efficiency improvement (reduction in seconds) compared with the original Kissat solver. (3) Halted represents the number of halted (time- out) CNFs within the given time (1,000 seconds). Please note that all the runtimes for NN- based solutions are network construction and inference time inclusive.
