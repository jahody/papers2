To further validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, IB- Net, we conducted a comprehensive case study focusing on three circuits that constitute a significant proportion of the LEC industrial dataset. For each of these circuits, we compared the runtime of IB- Net with that of the original Kissat method. Scatter plots in Fig. 5 present the comparisons. In these plots, each point corresponds to a single SAT problem from one of the three targeted circuits.  

The plots illustrate a clear trend: across a wide range of problem sizes, IB- Net consistently outperforms Kissat. This performance advantage of IB- Net holds true when facing substantial variability in size of problems within these circuits, which indicate that our method is not only faster but also scalable and capable of handling large and complex problems efficiently. These findings underscore the potential of IB- Net to improve the performance of SAT solver in LEC, confirming the practical applicability of our method in a real- world setting.
