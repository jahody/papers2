Boolean satisfiability problem (or the SAT problem) is to decide if there exists a set of 0- 1 (false/true) assignments to the Boolean variables in a given Boolean formula such that the formula evaluates to 1 (true). Solving the SAT problem is at the core of many applications, for example, the electronic design automation (EDA), where the growing complexity of hardware demands for more intelligent design and verification tools [Brand, 1993]. One of the classic applications of SAT solving in EDA is combinational logic equivalence checking, where two circuits for comparison are composed into one mixer circuit [Gupta et al., 2006]. This mixer circuit can be further converted into a conjunctive norm form (CNF) formula. If the formula is satisfiable, then the two circuits are not equivalent. In this paper, we refer to solving the Boolean formula in CNF as the SAT problem. If the problem input is directly in the circuit form, then we call it the Circuit- SAT problem.  

Traditionally, SAT and Circuit- SAT problems are solved by heuristic searching algorithms, for example, the Conflict- Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) algorithm [Marques- Silva and Sakallah, 1999], implemented in solvers like MiniSAT [Sorensson and Een, 2005] and Glucose [Audemard  

and Simon, 2014]. While SAT problems are NP- complete, heuristics play an important role in speeding up the algorithms. Many effective heuristics have been proposed so far. For example, the Variable State- Independent Decaying Sum (VSIDS) method was brought up to aid variable selection in the search process [Moskewicz et al., 2001]. Those heuristic algorithms have led to a huge improvement in computational efficiency. However, they are also limited by the greedy nature of their strategy and therefore, could be sub- optimal in certain cases [Shi et al., 2021].  

Recently, there has been a growing interest in applying machine learning methods to solve combinatorial problems, including the SAT problem [Duan et al., 2022]. With the help of deep neural networks (DNN), end- to- end models can learn the expected outcome from the problem description. For example, [Selsam et al., 2018] proposed the NeuroSAT architecture to approach SAT solving as a binary classification problem. NeuroSAT treats the input CNF as a bipartite graph and uses the graph neural network (GNN) to predict whether the set of CNF clauses is satisfiable or not. Compared to the existing heuristic searching method, NeuroSAT requires no pre- defined heuristics. [Amizadeh et al., 2018] considered the scenario when the problem formulation is in the form of a circuit (namely the Circuit- SAT problem). As the circuit is by nature a graph, the GNN- based architecture also applies here. Unlike NeuroSAT which requires extra steps to decode a satisfying assignment from a SAT prediction, the neural Circuit- SAT method in [Amizadeh et al., 2018] directly predicts the satisfying assignment. These existing GNN- based end- to- end methods have demonstrated the potential of using machine- learning techniques in SAT solving.  

Although prior works showed that it is possible to predict SAT solutions from the graph structure of the problem formulation, we identify an important flaw in these existing GNN- based end- to- end SAT solving methods: there exists a set of satisfiable CNF formulas (correspondingly, a set of satisfiable circuits for the Circuit- SAT problem) whose satisfying assignments cannot be learned by the existing methods in [Selsam et al., 2018] or [Amizadeh et al., 2018]. These CNF formulas (or circuits) have symmetric formulations, but their solutions are asymmetric. Here, symmetry means swapping a pair of variables resulting in exactly the same CNF formula (or circuit). However, a satisfying assignment requires that the two symmetric variables must take different values. A
simple example is the formula (or the circuit) that encodes " \(a\oplus b\) ", where \(a\) and \(b\) are two Boolean variables and " \(\oplus\) " is the XOR operation. Due to the commutativity of XOR, " \(b\oplus a\) " is equivalent to " \(a\oplus b\) ". However, a satisfying assignment requires \(a\) and \(b\) to take different values because only " \(0\oplus 1\) " or " \(1\oplus 0\) " results in 1. Existing methods predict Boolean assignments for \(a\) and \(b\) concurrently. The concurrent prediction on each variable solely depends on the graph embedding of the variable node. Meanwhile, \(a\) and \(b\) share the same embedding because they are symmetric in CNF or circuit form. Therefore, the predictions for \(a\) and \(b\) inevitably become the same, which is clearly not a satisfying variable assignment for the formula.  

We attribute this problem to the concurrent prediction in existing model that does not factor in variable dependency in SAT problems. Variable dependency refers to the fact that the prediction of one variable assignment will affect other variables. In the " \(a\oplus b\) " example, if \(a\) is assigned to be 0, then \(b\) must be 1, despite that \(a\) and \(b\) are symmetric. To address this problem, we introduce a recurrent neural network (RNN) in the SAT assignment decoding layer. With the help of RNN, later predictions will be able to "remember" prior variable assignments. We call our new model AsymSAT, because it can produce asymmetric SAT solutions given symmetric SAT problems. We show by experiments that this small change can significantly improve GNN- based SAT solving.  

Overall, our main contributions in this paper are:  

- We identify the need of addressing variable dependency in the existing GNN-based end-to-end SAT solving methods.- We propose an improvement to the neural network architecture to take dependency among variables into consideration. Our AsymSAT model uses RNN to make sequential predictions of SAT solutions.- We demonstrate that with this small change, AsymSAT achieves a higher accuracy in SAT and Circuit-SAT solving compared to prior works. In addition to the end-to-end machine-learning-based SAT solving, the idea of sequential predictions proposed in this paper could potentially also benefit hybrid SAT solvers that take machine-learning as one searching heuristic.  

The paper is organized as follows: the next section provides a background on SAT problems and the existing GNN- based end- to- end SAT solving methods. Section 3 highlights the variable dependency in SAT solving. Section 4 introduces our improvement to the GNN architecture for SAT solving, followed by experiments in Section 5 and the related works in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.
