When the problem is formulated in the circuit form, we automatically have a graph structure. Graph neural network can be similarly applied in Circuit- SAT problems. Note that any logic function can be implemented with only AND gates and NOT gates. A circuit graph made up of only these two types of gates forms an And- Inverter- Graph (AIG), which is commonly used in the EDA community. Amizadeh et al. developed a GNN- based model, named DG- DAGRNN to solve Circuit- SAT problems by machine learning [Amizadeh et al., 2018]. The types of graph nodes (whether a node is a logic
gate or a circuit input) are encoded as one- hot vectors, which are the inputs to the GNN model. Similar to NeuroSAT, message- passing generates node embeddings which are used to predict variable assignments. A message- passing iteration consists of one forward pass from circuit input nodes to the only circuit output node and one backward pass in the reversed order. Compared to NeuroSAT, message- passing in DG- DAGRNN follows the topological order and sequentially update node embeddings, whereas NeuroSAT updates all node embeddings concurrently.  

Both NeuroSAT and DG- DAGRNN predict SAT solutions concurrently without considering dependency among variables. This results in a fundamental weakness: they are unable to predict the correct solutions for certain symmetric graphs, as explained in the next section.
