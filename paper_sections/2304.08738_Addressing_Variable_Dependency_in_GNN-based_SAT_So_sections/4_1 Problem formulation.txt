Problem input. We expect the problem input to be a DAG representing the structure of the circuit. As discussed in Section 2, we only need to consider circuits made from AND gates and NOT gates. Each node in the DAG has an one- hot input feature vector that indicates the type of the node. There are in total three types: the primary inputs, AND gates and NOT gates. Formally, we expect the problem input to be the form of \(G = < V_G, N_G, E_G >\) , where \(V_G\) is a set of circuit nodes, \(N_G\) is a function that maps each node to its type, and \(E_G\) is the set of directed edges of the circuit graph. An edge between two nodes means that there is a wire connection from a logic gate or a circuit input to another gate.  

Problem output. The machine learning model should predict a 0- 1 assignment for each circuit input node. We denote the assignments as \(L \in \{0, 1\}^i\) and \(i\) is the number of circuit input nodes. Each instance in the dataset is in the form of \((G, L)\) , where the 0- 1 assignments are generated by an external SAT solver that works as the oracle.
