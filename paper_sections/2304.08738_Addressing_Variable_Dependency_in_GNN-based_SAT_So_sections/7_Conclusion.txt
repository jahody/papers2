This paper addresses the need of considering variable dependency when designing a machine- learning model for SAT solving. Specifically, the satisfying assignment to one variable is closely related to those made to other variables within the same SAT problem. This paper proposes using RNNs to make sequential predictions for SAT solving. Our experiments show that this improvement extends the solving capability on symmetric Circuit- SAT problems and achieves a higher solution rate on randomly generated SAT and Circuit- SAT instances compared to concurrent GNN- based SAT solving methods. Although this paper focuses on the end- to- end machine- learning- based SAT solvers, using RNNs to account for variable dependency may also benefit other hybrid SAT solvers that use machine learning as a guiding heuristic.
