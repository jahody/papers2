Selsam et al. proposed using a graph neural network to decide whether a Boolean formula in CNF is satisfiable or not [Selsam et al., 2018]. This is an end- to- end method, where the problem input is a bipartite graph with nodes representing either a literal or a clause in CNF. The only output of the neural network is a single bit representing the satisfiability of the formula. An edge between a literal node and a clause node in the bipartite graph indicates that the literal is contained in the clause. Each node has an initial embedding, which is updated by iterations of message- passing between literals and clauses. Finally, the literal embeddings are sent to a multi- layer perceptron (MLP) to generate a vote. The averaged vote from all literals is used to decide satisfiability. The paper also demonstrated it is possible to decode satisfying assignments from the literal embeddings via k- means clustering.
