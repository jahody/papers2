For AsymSAT, we apply the supervised learning method. We consider SAT solution prediction as a labeling problem — giving 0- 1 labels to each of the circuit input nodes. We use Cross- Entropy for the loss function, denoted as:  

\[\begin{array}{c}{Loss = -\Sigma_{i = 1}^{n}[g(v_{i})log(P(v_{i} = 1)) + }\\ {(1 - g(v_{i}))log(P(v_{i} = 0))]} \end{array} \quad (2)\]  

where \(g(v_{i})\) is the ground truth of the SAT assignment on \(v_{i}\) generated by an oracle SAT solver, \(P(v_{i} = 1)\) and \(P(v_{i} = 0)\) are the predicted probability of \(v_{i}\) to be 1 or 0.
