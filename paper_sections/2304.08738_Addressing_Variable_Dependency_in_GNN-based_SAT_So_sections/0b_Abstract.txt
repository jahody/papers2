Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is fundamental to many applications. Existing works have used graph neural networks (GNNs) for (approximate) SAT solving. Typical GNN- based end- to- end SAT solvers predict SAT solutions concurrently. We show that for a group of symmetric SAT problems, the concurrent prediction is guaranteed to produce a wrong answer because it neglects the dependency among Boolean variables in SAT problems. We propose AsymSAT, a GNN- based architecture which integrates recurrent neural networks to generate dependent predictions for variable assignments. The experiment results show that dependent variable prediction extends the solving capability of the GNN- based method as it improves the number of solved SAT instances on large test sets.
