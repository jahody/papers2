In Figure 7, we further provide the comparison with supervised baselines from Section 3.2 for the March base solver. On satisfiable 3SAT problems, our RLAF- trained policy and the guidance based on backbone prediction are roughly on par. However, on unsatisfiable 3SAT problems we found that backbone- based guidance increases the solver's runtime be approximately \(10\%\) . Backbone predictions are therefore not a useful guidance signal on this instance type when working with a strong base solver, such as March. Our RLAF- based policy does not share this problem. On the 3COL and CRYPTO distributions, the RLAF- trained policy consistently outperforms the guidance based on UNSAT core prediction, as for the Glucose base solver.
