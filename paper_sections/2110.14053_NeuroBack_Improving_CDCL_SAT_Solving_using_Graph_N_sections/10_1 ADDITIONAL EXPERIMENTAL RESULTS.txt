10.1 ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RESULTSThe scatter plots is another commonly used plot in the SAT community for comparing the solving effectiveness of two solvers on each problem. Fig. 5 shows the scatter plots of NeuroBack- Kissat and its two baseline solvers, Default- Kissat and Random- Kissat. It is evident that more dots are present in the lower triangular area, indicating that there are more problems on which NeuroBack- Kissat outperforms both Default- Kissat and Random- Kissat. Specifically, NeuroBack- Kissat outperforms Default- Kissat on 43 and 40 additional problems in SATCOMP- 2022 and SATCOMP- 2023, respectively, reducing solving time by 117 and 36 seconds per problem. Similarly, NeuroBack- Kissat outperforms Random- Kissat in SATCOMP- 2022 and SATCOMP- 2023 on 22 and 29 more problems, respectively, leading to a reduction in solving time of 98 and 246 seconds per problem.
