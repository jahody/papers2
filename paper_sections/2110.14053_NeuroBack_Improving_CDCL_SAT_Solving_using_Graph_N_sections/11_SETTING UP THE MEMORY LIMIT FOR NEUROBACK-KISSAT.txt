In our experimental setup, which includes a machine equipped with 256GB of memory running 64 solver instances in parallel, we have conservatively set the SAT formula size threshold at 135 MB. This ensures that the memory usage of each solver instance does not exceed our specified memory threshold of 10GB. This threshold setting is based on our practical experience. Increasing this threshold could potentially lead to memory contention issues. Users might choose to adjust the
formula size threshold based on their machine's memory capacity. Alternatively, they might simply establish a memory threshold for each solver instance based on their machine's memory capacity and allow model inference to proceed until this threshold is reached, which typically incurs an overhead of no more than a few seconds.
