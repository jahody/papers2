Platform All experiments were run on an ordinary commodity computer with one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 GPU (10GB memory), one AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X processor (64 logical cores), and 256GB RAM.  

Research Questions The experiments aim to answer two research questions:  

RQ1: How accurately does the NeuroBack model classify the phases of backbone variables? RQ2: How effective is the NeuroBack approach?  

RQ1: NeuroBack Model Performance The NeuroBack model was pre- trained on the entire DataBack- PT dataset, then fine- tuned on a random \(90\%\) of DataBack- FT samples, and evaluated on the remaining \(10\%\) as a validation set. Table 2 details the performance of both the pre- trained and fine- tuned models in classifying the phases of backbone variables. Notably, the pre- trained model achieved \(75.1\%\) accuracy in classifying backbone variables, with a precision exceeding \(90\%\) and a recall rate of \(76.7\%\) . Considering the distinct data sources of DataBack- PT and DataBack- FT, the results suggest that the pre- training enables the model to extract generalized knowledge about backbone phase prediction. Fine- tuning further augments model performance, with improvements ranging between \(4\%\) and \(15\%\) across all metrics, making precision, recall and F1 score all exceeding \(90\%\) . In conclusion, NeuroBack model effectively learns to predict the phases of backbone variables through both pre- training and fine- tuning.  

RQ2: NeuroBack Performance To evaluate the solving effectiveness, we collect all 800 CNF formulas from the main track of SATCOMP- 2022 SAT (2022) and SATCOMP- 2023 SAT (2023) as our testing dataset. For our baseline solvers, we selected the default configuration of Kissat, named Default- Kissat, which simply sets the initial phase of each variable to true. We implemented an additional baseline solver, Random- Kissat, which randomly assigns the initial phase of each variable as either true or false. NeuroBack- Kissat and its baseline solvers, were applied to all 800 SAT problems in the testing dataset, with the standard solving time limit of 5,000 seconds. Each solver utilized up to 64 different processes in parallel on the dedicated 64- core machine. The model inference for each NeuroBack solver was conducted solely on the CPU, with a memory limit of 10GB to mitigate memory contention issues. Consequently, 308 problems from SATCOMP- 2022 and

353 problems from SATCOMP- 2023 were successfully inferred. The CPU inference time for each of these problems ranged from 0.3 to 16.5 seconds, averaging at 1.7 seconds. Given that problems unsuccessfully inferred make the NeuroBack solver revert to its baseline, we exclude such problems from our evaluation of how NeuroBack contributes to SAT solving.  

As a result, for 308 inferred problems in SATCOMP- 2022, Default- Kissat and Random- Kissat solved 193 and 197 problems, respectively. In comparison, NeuroBack- Kissat solved 203 problems, representing an improvement of \(5.2\%\) over Default- Kissat and \(3.0\%\) over Random- Kissat, respectively. For 353 inferred problems in SATCOMP- 2023, Default- Kissat and Random- Kissat successfully solved 198 and 190 problems, respectively. In contrast, NeuroBack- Kissat solved 204 problems, making improvements of \(3.0\%\) and \(7.4\%\) over Default- Kissat and Random- Kissat, respectively.  

The cactus plot is a commonly used plot in the SAT community for demonstrating the solving, as shown in Fig. 4. Random- Kissat performs better than Default- Kissat in SATCOMP- 2022, but worse in SATCOMP- 2023. In contrast, NeuroBack- Kissat consistently outperforms both baseline solvers. Specifically, NeuroBack- Kissat outperforms Default- Kissat on 43 and 40 additional problems in SATCOMP- 2022 and SATCOMP- 2023, respectively, reducing solving time by 117 and 36 seconds per problem. Similarly, NeuroBack- Kissat outperforms Random- Kissat in SATCOMP- 2022 and SATCOMP- 2023 on 22 and 29 more problems, respectively, reducing solving time by 98 and 246 seconds per problem. For additional results, please refer to the Appendix section. Overall, results suggest that the phase initialization provided by NeuroBack outperforms both the default and random phase initializations in Kissat, exhibiting enhanced proficiency in solving SATCOMP- 2022 and SATCOMP- 2023 problems.
