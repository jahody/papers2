The goal is to leverage phase predictions derived from the GNN model to enhance the phase selection heuristics within CDCL SAT solvers. While numerous ways exist to integrate these neural predictions into CDCL SAT solvers, the most straightforward and generic approach is to initialize the phases of the corresponding variables in CDCL SAT solvers based on the predicted phases. In this paper, we adopted the state- of- the- art solver Kissat Biere & Fleury (2022) to support the phase initialization with NeuroBack predictions. The resulting implementation is called NeuroBack- Kissat.
