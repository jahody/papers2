Given that the phases of backbone variables remain consistent across all satisfying assignments, selecting the correct phase for a backbone variable prevents backtracking. Conversely, an incorrect choice inevitably leads to a conflict. Moreover, the proportion of backbone variables is typically significant. For instance, during our data collection from five notable sources (i.e., CNFgen, SATLIB, model counting competitions, SATCOMP random tracks, and SATCOMP main tracks), backbone variables constitute an average of \(27\%\) of the total variables. Therefore, accurately identifying the phases of the backbone variables is crucial for efficiently solving a SAT formula. Furthermore, identifying the phases of the non- backbone variables appearing in the majority of satisfying assignments is also important. Because such phases could prevent backtracking with high probabilities.  

With the converted graph representation, predicting the phases of all variables, including backbone and non- backbone variables, is a binary node classification problem, which can be addressed by a GNN model. Inspired by transfer learning Zhuang et al. (2020), we first train a GNN model to predict the phases of backbone variables, and then leverage the trained model to predict the phases of all variables. Our key insight is that the knowledge learned from predicting the phases of backbone variables can provide a valuable guidance on predicting the phases of non- backbone variables exhibiting in the majority of satisfying assignments. The following subsections introduce the design, implementation, and training of our GNN model.
