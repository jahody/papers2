As in recent work Kurin et al. (2020); Yolcu & Póczos (2019), a SAT formula is represented using a more compact undirected bipartite graph than the one adopted in NeuroCore. Two node types

represent the variables and clauses, respectively. Each edge connects a variable node to a clause node, representing that the clause contains the variable. Two edge types represent two polarities of a variable appearing in the clause, i.e., the variable itself and its complement. Although the representation is compact, its diameter might be substantial for large- scale SAT formulas, which could result in insufficient message passing during the learning process.  

To mitigate this issue, we introduce a meta node for each connected component in the graph, with meta edges connecting the meta node to all clause nodes in the component. With the added meta nodes and edges, every variable node not appearing in the same clauses can reach each other through their corresponding clause nodes and the meta node, thereby making the diameter at most four. Figure 2 shows an example of our graph representation for the CNF formula \((v_{1} \lor v_{2}) \land (v_{2} \lor v_{3}) \land (v_{3} \lor v_{4})\) . It includes one meta node, four variable nodes and three clause nodes \(c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}\) , representing clauses \(v_{1} \lor v_{2}, v_{2} \lor v_{3}\) and \(v_{3} \lor v_{4}\) , respectively. Without the added meta node and edges, the longest path in the graph runs from variable node \(v_{1}\) to variable node \(v_{4}\) , making the diameter six. However, by introducing the meta node and edges, the diameter is reduced to four.  

Formally, for a graph representation \(G = (V, E, W, H)\) of a CNF formula, the edge feature \(W_{u, v}\) of each edge \((u, v)\) is initialized by its edge type with the value 0 representing the meta edge, the value 1 representing positive polarity, and \(- 1\) negative polarity; the node feature \(H_{v}\) of each node \(v\) is initialized by its node type with 0 representing a meta node, 1 representing a variable node, and \(- 1\) representing a clause node.

A meta node \(m\) is added along with meta edges (represented by dashed lines) connecting to all clause nodes in the connected component, reducing the graph diameter from six to four. </center>
