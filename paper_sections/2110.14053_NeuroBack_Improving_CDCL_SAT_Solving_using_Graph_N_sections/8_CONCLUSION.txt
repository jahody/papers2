This paper proposes a machine learning approach, NeuroBack, to make CDCL SAT solvers more effective without requiring any GPU resource during its application. The main idea is to make offline model inference on variable phases appearing in the majority of satisfying assignments, for enhancing the phase selection heuristic in CDCL solvers. Incorporated in the state- of- the- art SAT solver, Kissat, this approach significantly reduces the solving time and makes it possible to solve more instances in SATCOMP- 2022 and SATCOMP- 2023. NeuroBack is thus a promising approach to improving the SAT solvers through machine learning.
