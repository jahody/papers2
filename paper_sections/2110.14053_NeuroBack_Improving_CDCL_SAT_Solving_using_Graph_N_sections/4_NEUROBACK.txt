In order to reduce the computational cost of the online model inference and to make CDCL SAT solving more effective, NeuroBack employs offline model predictions on variable phases to enhance the phase selection heuristics in CDCL solvers. Figure 1 shows the overview of NeuroBack. First, it converts the input CNF formula into a compact and more learnable graph representation. Then, a well- designed GNN model trained to predict the phases of backbone variables, is applied on the converted graph representation to infer the phases of all variables. The model inference is performed only once before the SAT solving process. The resulting offline prediction is applied as an initialization for the SAT solving process. Finally, the enhanced SAT solver outputs the satisfiability of the input CNF formula. The key components of NeuroBack including the graph representation of CNF formulas, the GNN- based phase selection, and the phase prediction application in SAT solvers, are illustrated in the subsections below.
