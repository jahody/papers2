The current implementation of NeuroBack has two main aspects to improve. First, pre- training the GNN model requires a large amount of data. Once trained, however, the model is able to easily generalize to new problem categories, so the investment in putting together a large dataset is warranted. The dataset will also be publicly available to benefit future research. Second, this paper employs neural phase predictions solely as an initial setting for variable phases in SAT solvers. However, multiple methods exist to utilize these predictions in SAT, either in a static or dynamic manner, which are likely to yield further performance enhancements. For instance, phase predictions could be leveraged dynamically during rephasing to adjust or diversify the exploration of the search space.
