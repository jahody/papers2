While G4SATBench represents a significant step in evaluating GNNs for SAT solving, there are still some limitations and potential future directions to consider. Firstly, G4SATBench primarily focuses on evaluating standalone neural SAT solvers, excluding the exploration of neural- guided SAT solvers that integrate GNNs with search- based SAT solvers. It also should be emphasized that the instances included in G4SATBench are considerably smaller compared to most practical instances found in real- world applications, where GNN models alone are not sufficient for solving such large- scale instances. The efficacy of GNN models in unsat- core prediction shows a promising avenue for combining GNNs with modern SAT solvers, and future research could explore more techniques to effectively leverage these neural- guided SAT solvers to scale up to real- world instances. Secondly, G4SATBench benchmarks general GNN models on the LCG\* and VCG\* graph representations for SAT solving, but does not consider sophisticated GNN models designed for specific graph constructions in certain domains, such as Circuit SAT problems. Investigating domain- specific GNN models tailored to the characteristics of specific problems could lead to improved performance in specialized instances. Lastly, all existing GNN- based SAT solvers in the literature are static GNNs, which have limited learning ability to capture the CDCL heuristic. Exploring dynamic GNN models that can effectively learn the CDCL heuristic is also a potential direction for future research.
