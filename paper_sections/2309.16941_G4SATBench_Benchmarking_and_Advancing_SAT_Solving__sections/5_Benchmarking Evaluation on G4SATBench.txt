In this section, we present the benchmarking results of G4SATBench. To ensure a fair comparison, we conduct a grid search to tune the hyperparameters of each GNN baseline. The best checkpoint for each GNN model is selected based on its performance on the validation set. To mitigate the impact of randomness, we use 3 different random seeds to repeat the experiment in each setting and report the average performance. Each experiment is performed on a single RTX8000 GPU and 16 AMD EPYC 7502 CPU cores, and the total time cost is approximately 8,000 GPU hours. For detailed experimental setup and hyperparameters, please refer to Appendix C.1.
