Message-passing schemes on VCG*. Recall that VCG* incorporates two distinct edge types, G4SATBench employs different functions to execute heterogeneous message-passing in each direction of each edge type. Formally, we define a d-dimensional embedding for each variable and clause node, denoted by \(h_l\) and \(h_c\), respectively. These embeddings are initialized to two learnable vectors \(h_v^0\) and \(h_c^0\), depending on the node type. At the \(k\)-th iteration of message passing, these hidden representations are updated as follows: 

\[h_v^{(k)} = \mathrm{UPD}\left(\mathrm{AGG}\left(\left\{\mathrm{MLP}_v^+ \left(h_v^{(k-1)}\right)\right\}\right), \mathrm{AGG}\left(\left\{\mathrm{MLP}_v^- \left(h_v^{(k-1)}\right)\right\}\right), h_c^{(k-1)}\right), \quad (7)\] \[h_v^{(k)} = \mathrm{UPD}\left(\mathrm{AGG}\left(\left\{\mathrm{MLP}_c^+ \left(h_c^{(k-1)}\right)\right\}\right), \mathrm{AGG}\left(\left\{\mathrm{MLP}_c^- \left(h_c^{(k-1)}\right)\right\}\right), h_v^{(k-1)}\right),\]

where \(c^+\) and \(c^-\) denote the sets of variable nodes that occur in the clause \(c\) with positive and negative polarity, respectively. Similarly, \(v^+\) and \(v^-\) denote the sets of clause nodes where variable \(v\) occurs in positive and negative form. \(\mathrm{MLP}_v^+\), \(\mathrm{MLP}_v^-\), \(\mathrm{MLP}_c^+\), and \(\mathrm{MLP}_c^-\) are four MLPs. \(\mathrm{UPD}(\cdot)\) is the update function, and \(\mathrm{AGG}(\cdot)\) is the aggregation function. 

GNN baselines. Table 9 summarizes the message-passing algorithms of the GNN models used in G4SATBench. We adopt heterogeneous versions of GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2017), GGNN (Li et al., 2016), and GIN (Xu et al., 2019) on both LCG* and VCG*, while maintaining the original NeuroSAT (Selsam et al., 2019) only on LCG*.
