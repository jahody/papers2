Generators. To generate high- quality SAT datasets that do not contain trivial instances, we have employed a rigorous process of selecting appropriate parameters for each CNF generator in G4SATBench. Table 7 provides detailed information about the generators we have used.

<table><tr><td>Dataset</td><td>Description</td><td>Parameters</td><td>Notes</td></tr><tr><td>SR</td><td>The SR dataset is composed of pairs of satisfiable and unsatisfiable formulas, with the only difference between each pair being the polarity of a single literal. Given the number of variables n, the synthetic generator iteratively samples k = 1+Bernoulli(b)+Geometric(g) vari-ables uniformly at random without replacement and negates each one with independent probability 50% to build a clause. This procedure continues until the generated formula is unsatisfiable. The satisfiable instance is then constructed by negating the first literal in the last clause of the unsatisfiable one.</td><td>General: b = 0.3, g = 0.4, Easy dataset: n ~ Uniform(10, 40), Medium dataset: n ~ Uniform(40, 200), Hard dataset: n ~ Uniform(200, 400)</td><td>The sampling parameters are the same as the original paper (Selsam et al., 2019).</td></tr><tr><td>3-SAT</td><td>The 3-SAT dataset comprises CNF formulas at the phase transition, where the proportion of generated satisfiable and unsatisfiable formu- las is roughly equal. Given the number of variables n and clauses m, the synthetic generator iteratively samples three variables (and their polarities) uniformly at random until m clauses are obtained.</td><td>General: m = 4.258n + 58.26n-2/3, Easy dataset: n ~ Uniform(10, 40), Medium dataset: n ~ Uniform(40, 200), Hard dataset: n ~ Uniform(200, 300)</td><td>The parameter m is the same as the paper (Crawford &amp;amp; Auton, 1996)</td></tr><tr><td>CA</td><td>The CA dataset contains SAT instances that are designed to mimic the community structures and modularity features found in real-world industrial instances. Given variable number n, clause number m, clause size k, community number c, and modularity Q, the synthetic generator iteratively selects k literals in the same community uni- formly at random with probability P = Q + 1/c and selects k literals in the distinct community uniformly at random with probability 1-P to build a clause and repeat for m times to construct a CNF formula.</td><td>General: m ~ Uniform(13n, 15n), k ~ Uniform(4, 5), c ~ Uniform(3, 10), Q ~ Uniform(0.7, 0.9) Easy dataset: n ~ Uniform(10, 40), Medium dataset: n ~ Uniform(40, 200), Hard dataset: n ~ Uniform(200, 400)</td><td>The parameters are selected based on the experiments in the original paper (Giráldez-Cru &amp;amp; Levy, 2015) and our study to ensure that the generated SAT instances have a balance of satisfiability and unsatisfiability.</td></tr><tr><td>PS</td><td>PS dataset encompasses SAT instances with a power-law distribution in the number of variable occurrences (popularity), and good class- tering between them (similarity). Given variable number n, clause number m, and average clause size k, the synthetic generator first as- signs random angles θi, θj ∈ [0, 2π] to each variable i and each clause j, and then randomly samples variable i in clause j with the proba- bility P = 1/(1+(iβjβi/R)T). Here, θij = π-|π-|θi-|θj| is the angle between variable i and clause j. The exponent parameters β and β′ control the power-law distribution of variable occurrences and clause size respectively. The temperature parameter T controls the sharpness of the probability distribution, while R is an approximate normalization constant that ensures the average number of selected edges is km.</td><td>General: m ~ Uniform(6n, 8n), k ~ Uniform(4, 5), β ~ Uniform(0, 1), β′ = 1, c ~ Uniform(3, 10), T ~ Uniform(0.75, 1.5) Easy dataset: n ~ Uniform(10, 40), Medium dataset: n ~ Uniform(40, 200), Hard dataset: n ~ Uniform(200, 300)</td><td>The parameters are selected based on the experiments in the original paper (Giráldez-Cru &amp;amp; Levy, 2017) and our study to ensure that the generated SAT instances have a balance of satisfiability and unsatisfiability.</td></tr><tr><td>k-Clique</td><td>The k-Clique dataset includes SAT instances that encode the k-Clique problem, which involves determining whether there exists a clique (i.e., a subset of vertices that are all adjacent to each other) with v vertices in a given graph. Given the number of cliques k, the synthetic generator produces an Erdős-Rényi graph with v vertices and a given edge probability p and then transforms the corresponding k-Clique problem into a SAT instance.</td><td>General: p = (v)k-1/(v), Easy dataset: v ~ Uniform(5, 15), k ~ Uniform(3, 4), Medium dataset: v ~ Uniform(15, 20), k ~ Uniform(3, 5), Hard dataset: v ~ Uniform(20, 25), k ~ Uniform(4, 6)</td><td>The parameter p is selected based on the paper (Bollobás &amp;amp; Erdős, 1976), making the expected number of k-Cliques in the generated graph equals 1.</td></tr><tr><td>k-Domset</td><td>The k-Domset dataset contains SAT instances that encode the k-Dominating Set problem. This problem is to determine whether there exists a dominating set (i.e., a subset of vertices such that every vertex in the graph is either in the subset or adjacent to a vertex in the sub- set) with at most k vertices in a given graph. Given the domination number k, the synthetic generator produces an Erdős-Rényi graph with v vertices and a given edge probability p and then transforms the corresponding k-Dominating Set problem into a SAT instance.</td><td>General: p = 1-(1-(v)k-1/(v)k), Easy dataset: v ~ Uniform(5, 15), k ~ Uniform(2, 3), Medium dataset: v ~ Uniform(15, 20), k ~ Uniform(3, 5), Hard dataset: v ~ Uniform(20, 25), k ~ Uniform(4, 6)</td><td>The parameter p is selected based on the paper (Wieland &amp;amp; Godbole, 2001), making the expected number of domination set with size k in the generated graph equals 1.</td></tr><tr><td>k-Vercov</td><td>The k-Vercov dataset consists of SAT instances that encode the k-Vercov problem, i.e., check whether there exists a set of k vertices in a graph such that every edge has at least one endpoint in this set. Given the vertex cover number k, the synthetic generator produces a complement graph of an Erdős-Rényi graph with v vertices and a given edge probability p and then converts the corresponding k-Vercov Cover problem into a SAT instance.</td><td>General: p = (v)k-1/(v), Easy dataset: v ~ Uniform(5, 15), k ~ Uniform(3, 5), Medium dataset: v ~ Uniform(10, 20), k ~ Uniform(6, 8), Hard dataset: v ~ Uniform(15, 25), k ~ Uniform(9, 10)</td><td>The generation process and the parameter are selected based on the relationship between k-Vercov Cover and k-Clique problems, making the size of the minimum vertex cover in the generated graph around k.</td></tr></table>
Statistics. To provide a comprehensive understanding of our generated datasets, we compute several characteristics across three difficulty levels. These statistics include the average number of variables and clauses, as well as graph measures such as average clustering coefficient (in VIG) and modularity (in VIG, VCG, and LCG). The dataset statistics are summarized in Table 8.
