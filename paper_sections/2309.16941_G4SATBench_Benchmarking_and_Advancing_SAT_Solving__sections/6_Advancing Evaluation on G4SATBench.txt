To gain deeper insights into how GNNs tackle the SAT problem, we conduct comprehensive comparative analyses between GNN- based SAT solvers and the CDCL and LS heuristics in this section. Since these search heuristics aim to solve a SAT instance directly, our focus only lies on the tasks of (T1) satisfiability prediction and (T2) satisfying assignment prediction (with \(\mathrm{UNS}_2\) as the training loss). We employ NeuroSAT (on \(\mathrm{LCG}^*\) ) and GGNN (on \(\mathrm{VCG}^*\) ) as our GNN models and experiment on the SR and 3- SAT datasets. Detailed experimental settings are included in Appendix D.1.
