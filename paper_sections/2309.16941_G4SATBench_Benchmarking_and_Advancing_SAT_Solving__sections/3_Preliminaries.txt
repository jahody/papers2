The SAT problem. In propositional logic, a Boolean formula is constructed from Boolean variables and logical operators such as conjunctions \((\wedge)\) , disjunctions \((\vee)\) , and negations \((\neg)\) . It is typical to represent Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF), expressed as a conjunction of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction of literals, which can be either a variable or its negation. Given a CNF formula, the SAT problem is to determine if there exists an assignment of boolean values to its variables such that the formula evaluates to true. If this is the case, the formula is called satisfiable; otherwise, it is unsatisfiable. For a satisfiable instance, one is expected to construct a satisfying assignment to prove its satisfiability. On the other hand, for an unsatisfiable formula, one can find a minimal subset of clauses whose conjunction is still unsatisfiable. Such a set of clauses is termed the unsat core, and variables in the unsat core are referred to as unsat- core variables.  

Graph representations of CNF formulas. Traditionally, a CNF formula can be represented using 4 types of graphs (Biere et al., 2009): Literal- Clause Graph (LCG), Variable- Clause Graph (VCG), Literal- Incidence Graph (LIG), and Variable- Incidence Graph (VIG). The LCG is a bipartite graph with literal and clause nodes connected by edges indicating the presence of a literal in a clause. The VCG is formed by merging the positive and negative literals of the same variables in LCG. The LIG, on the other hand, only consists of literal nodes, with edges indicating co- occurrence in a clause. Lastly, the VIG is derived from LIG using the same merging operation as VCG.
