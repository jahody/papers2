7.2 ConclusionIn this work, we present G4SATBench, a benchmark study that comprehensively evaluates GNN models in SAT solving. G4SATBench offers curated synthetic SAT datasets sourced from various domains and difficulty levels and benchmarks a wide range of GNN- based SAT solvers under diverse settings. Our empirical analysis yields valuable insights into the performances of GNN- based SAT solvers and further provides a deeper understanding of their capabilities and limitations. We hope the proposed G4SATBench will serve as a solid foundation for GNN- based SAT solving and inspire future research in this exciting field.
