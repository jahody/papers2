G4SATBench is built on a diverse set of synthetic CNF generators. It currently consists of 7 datasets sourced from 3 distinct domain areas: random problems, pseudo- industrial problems, and combinatorial problems. Specifically, we utilize the SR generator in NeuroSAT (Selsam et al., 2019) and the 3- SAT generator in CNFGen (Lauria et al., 2017) to produce random CNF formulas. For pseudo- industrial problems, we employ the Community Attachment (CA) model (Giráldez- Cruz & Levy, 2015) and the Popularity- Similarity (PS) model (Giráldez- Cruz & Levy, 2017), which generate synthetic instances that exhibit similar statistical features, such as the community and the locality, to those observed in real- world industrial SAT instances. For combinatorics, we resort to 3 synthetic generators in CNFGen (Lauria et al., 2017) to create SAT instances derived from the translation of \(k\) - Clique, \(k\) - Dominating Set, and \(k\) - Vertex Cover problems.

In addition to the diversity of datasets, G4SATBench offers distinct difficulty levels for all datasets to enable fine- grained analyses. These levels include easy, medium, and hard, with the latter representing more complex problems with increased instance sizes. For example, the easy SR dataset contains instances with 10 to 40 variables, the medium SR dataset contains formulas with 40 to 200 variables, and the hard SR dataset consists of formulas with variables ranging from 200 to 400. For each easy and medium dataset, we generate 80k pairs of satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances for training, 10k pairs for validation, and 10k pairs for testing. For each hard dataset, we produce 10k testing pairs. It is also worth noting that the parameters for our synthetic generators are meticulously selected to avoid generating trivial cases. For instance, we produce random 3- SAT formulas at the phase- transition region where the relationship between the number of clauses \((m)\) and variables \((n)\) is \(m = 4.258n + 58.26n^{- 2 / 3}\) (Crawford & Auton, 1996), and utilize the \(v\) vertex Erdős- Rényi graph with an edge probability of \(p = \binom{v}{k}^{- 1 / \binom{v}{2}}\) to generate \(k\) - Clique problems, making the expected number of \(k\) - Cliques in a graph equals 1 (Bollobás & Erdős, 1976). To provide a detailed characterization of our generated datasets, we compute several statistics of the SAT instances across difficulty levels in G4SATBench.
