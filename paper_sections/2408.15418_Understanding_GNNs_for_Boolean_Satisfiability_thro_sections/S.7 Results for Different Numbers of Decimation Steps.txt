In Table 2, we show the effect of running the decimation process multiple times. On our test sets, the decimation process did not result in any further improvement when repeated more than twice. The hyperparameters are the same as for the experiments in Table 1 (with 16 random init. samples per formula in the first pass and 1 random init. sample for each subsequent pass). We note that we did not try to optimize the decimation threshold, which could lead to further improvements.  

Table 2: This table shows a number of problems solved after subsequent application of the decimation procedure.
