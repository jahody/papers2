In this section, we describe the datasets we use for evaluation, model/training hyperparameters and experimental results. The experimental results are divided into qualitative findings where we present general observations supporting the connection to SDP and quantitative findings where we compare our improvements to the original NeuroSAT model.
<center>Figure 3: Validation accuracy during training. Our model with a curriculum achieves reaches \(85\%\) in approximately 30 minutes, whereas the original NeuroSAT implementation needs over 5 hours. For comparison, we also add our implementation trained on the same data, but without a curriculum. The training of each model stops once it achieves an accuracy of \(85\%\) on a validation set. </center>
