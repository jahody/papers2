Random satisfiability provides a natural and simplified setting to study the computational hardness of finding a satisfying assignment and the structure of the space of satisfying assignments. Typically, it is assumed that each clause in the formula is sampled randomly and has the same number of variables \((k)\) . A random formula is parametrized by a parameter \(\alpha\) denoting the clause- to- variable ratio. As the problem size increases asymptotically, the solution space undergoes several phase transitions as the parameter \(\alpha\) changes. When random clauses are added to the formula, it becomes increasingly challenging to find a satisfying assignments until it reaches a point where the formula becomes unsatisfiable. This occurs at the satisfiability threshold whose value for \(k > 2\) is known only through upper and lower bounds and numerical estimates [34].  

Before reaching the phase transition to unsatisfiability, the geometry of the solution space undergoes several other phase transitions, during which the set of solutions breaks into well- separated clusters (in terms of the Hamming distance) [15]. Each cluster corresponds to a set of solutions in which specific variables are fixed (to a value 0 or 1) and the values of the remaining variables could vary (this is denoted by the value \(\ast\) ).  

Unlike real- world formulas, random formulas could be efficiently solved by message- passing algorithms [3]. These algorithms could be viewed as algorithms that compute the marginal probability of individual variables using a belief propagation algorithm (BP) [15]. The marginal probability that a variable \(x_{i}\) will have a value 1 in a satisfying assignment is given by a proportion of assignments where \(x_{i} = 1\) among all possible satisfiable assignments. Belief propagation can compute these marginal probabilities exactly for formulas whose factor graphs are devoid of loops. Clearly, computing these marginal probabilities exactly for a generic formula is much harder than finding a single satisfying assignment. For factor graphs with loops, BP can be regarded as an algorithm that tries to approximate these marginal probabilities [20].  

To obtain an algorithm for finding a satisfying assignment with BP, one can employ a decimation procedure in which variables with the most extreme estimated marginal values are fixed \(^{1}\) and the whole process is repeated by running the BP process again on the reduced formula until no variable has a sufficiently high estimated marginal. At this point, the resulting formula would be solved by a local search.  

Empirically, it has been observed that BP starts to fail as the parameter \(\alpha\) approaches the satisfiability threshold. This phenomenon is frequently attributed to the evolving structure of the solution space [20]. As the parameter \(\alpha\) increases, long- range correlations between variables start to appear \(^{2}\) and this breaks the assumption needed for BP to work properly.
Braunstein et al. [3] overcome this problem by drawing on concepts from statistical physics to design an algorithm called Survey Propagation (SP). It can be viewed as a BP running on an augmented factor graph of the original formula in which each variable can take one of three values: 0, 1, \(*\) , where the value \(*\) corresponds to undecided. SP was empirically shown to find satisfying assignments of problems with parameter \(\alpha\) very close to the satisfiability threshold. Similarly to BP, SP works by iteratively sending messages on a literal-clause factor graph until the convergence threshold is reached. Unlike BP, the messages from literals to clauses have the form of 3- dimensional vectors expressing the marginals for the three possible values.
