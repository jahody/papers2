As already mentioned in the main text, we demonstrate the efficacy of our model solely on datasets with a low number of variables, without incorporating any "real- world" problems. It is important to note that end- to- end trained machine learning models such as GNNs cannot compete with specialized solvers such as CDCL SAT solvers. We did not aim to compete with state- of- the- art SAT solvers on realistic benchmarks; instead, our focus is on understanding the reason why GNNs are able to correctly predict satisfiability.  

Furthermore, more research is still needed to determine the precise mechanism by which the GNN "optimizes" the embeddings during the message- passing process (i.e. how to interpret the messages and the updates of the embeddings provided by the LSTMs). Our study mainly focused on an empirical evaluation rather than a precise theoretical model.
