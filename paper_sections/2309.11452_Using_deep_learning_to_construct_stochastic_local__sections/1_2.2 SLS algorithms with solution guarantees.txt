As described above, one core contribution of this work is to choose a solver and loss function for training such that we are guaranteed by theoretical results that a smaller loss will lead to better performance. The body of work we have in mind here is that around the seminal Lovász Local Lemma (LLL) [18]. In particular, Ref. [12, 13] proved the results that underlie our Proposition 2.1. Ref. [19] explicitly introduces the notion of an oracle- based SLS algorithm, even though their resampling oracles are special cases of the oracles we consider here. Ref. [14] proves the results stated below as Proposition 2.2 and that we consider as crucial for motivating our work in settings where an oracle does not satisfy the conditions of the LLL.
While no runtime results other than those in Ref. [20, 21] are known to us for the WalkSAT algorithm [22], we include it here for its strong performance in competitions, especially the oracle- like working of the ProbSAT algorithm from Ref. [23] that served as an inspiration for Algorithm 2.
