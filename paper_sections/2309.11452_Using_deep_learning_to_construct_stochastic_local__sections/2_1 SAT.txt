The SAT decision problem is to decide whether a given formula \(\phi\) , that is, a formula consisting of \(n\) Boolean variables connected by the Boolean operators (conjunction \(\wedge\) , disjunction \(\vee\) and negation \(\neg\) ), admits a truth value assignment \(x \in \{0,1\}^{n}\) to the \(n\) variables such that the formula, as a whole, evaluates to true under this assignment. For every formula, there exists an equivalent formula that is in conjunctive normal form (CNF) which is a conjunction of clauses,  

\[\phi = (c_{1}\wedge c_{2}\wedge \ldots \wedge c_{m}), \quad (1)\]  

where each clause is a disjunction of literals (i.e. variables or their negation),  

\[c_{j} = (l_{1}^{(j)}\vee l_{2}^{(j)}\vee \ldots \vee l_{k}^{(j)}). \quad (2)\]  

SAT is NP- complete (see Refs. [1, 2]) and has many applications in industry. For example, it can be used to verify hardware and software, to plan and schedule, and to solve problems in cryptography.  

Notationwise, in the following we write \([n] \equiv \{1,\ldots ,n\}\) , \(c \in \phi\) to denote that the clause \(c\) is present in a CNF- formula \(\phi\) , \(V(c) \subseteq [n]\) to denote the set of variables present in \(c\) . We further split \(V(c)\) into disjoint subsets \(V^{+}(c)\) and \(V^{- }(c)\) , depending on whether the variables appear in \(c\) with or without negation, respectively. For any assignment \(x\) and any subset \(V \subseteq [n]\) of variables, we write \(x|_{V} = (x_{v})_{v \in V}\) to denote the truncated assignment on \(V\) , \(c(x) \in \{0,1\}\) to indicate whether a clause is violated or not, and \(\phi (x) = \sum_{j} c_{j}(x)\) to denote the number of violated clauses. Finally, we write \(X_{n} \equiv \{0,1\}^{n}\) and, for an instance \(\phi\) , we denote as \(\Pi (\phi) \subset X_{n}\) the set of assignments with the minimal number of violated constraints across \(I_{n}\) . An instance is satisfiable if there exists an \(x\) such that \(\phi (x) = 0\) and unsatisfiable otherwise.
