In this work, we have presented an approach to use deep learning to construct SLS- based SAT solvers. The main contribution is that we design the algorithms and loss functions in such a way that the training process is guaranteed, by theoretical results, to, in expectation, produce a stronger solver. The hope is that with this approach we can create solvers for SAT and constraint optimization more generally, that are highly performant on for specific applications, while also being provably robust in terms of their average performance.  

We have empirically investigated this promise on a random 3- SAT dataset, with promising results. However, the practical potential of our approach remains largely unchartered, as more thorough experiments on larger and application- oriented datasets, more research on suitable deep learning architectures, as well as the application to more mature and sophisticated SLS solvers, needs to be carried out, since the resulting solvers are currently far from being competitive with state of the art solvers.  

We leave these experiments for future research and hope that the preliminary results presented in this paper nevertheless establish the promise of the idea.
