Ref. [3] provides a recent review paper on machine learning- based SAT solvers. Focussing here on the literature on SLS solvers, in Ref. [11] the authors train a Graph Neural Network to generate an initial candidate for various SLS solvers. However, they don't use this GNN as an oracle in the course of running these solvers. Ref. [10] uses a GNN to learn a variable selection heuristic in the course of a WalkSAT type SLS solver. However, their model is based on a learned policy and hence doesn't act as an oracle in the sense of this work. The cross- entropy loss with respect to a Gibbs distribution that we use in this work is also used in Ref. [17] in the context of Mixed Integer Program solving.
