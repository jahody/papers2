We compare three different variants of both for the MT- algorithm and for WalkSAT, namely  

- the original version that uses the uniform oracle,- a "hybrid" version that uses the trained oracle just for initialization and then switches to uniform updating, and- the full oracle-based algorithm that uses the oracle for both initialization and updating.  

In Table 1, we provide a summary of the results. We find that for both solvers, the full oracle- based algorithm outperforms both others across the board. Moreover, the WalkSAT algorithm dominates the MT algorithm on each of the variants. A particularly dramatic improvement is seen in terms of the median steps required, where the boosted MT algorithm is faster by a factor of more than 8, while the boosted WalkSAT provides a speed- up by a factor of around 5. This indicates that the boosted solvers are especially powerful when solving relatively simple instances. A less dramatic but still significant improvement is seen in the mean number of steps, where we see an average decrease of \(35\%\) across solvers.

In Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, we display more detailed information of the experiments. We find that, in terms of \(\alpha\) , access to the GNN- based oracle “shifts the curve to the right” for \(\alpha\) around 3.0 to 3.2 for the boosted MT algorithm. A similar behaviour is found for the boosted WalkSAT algorithm. In particular, averaged across solvers, the average value of \(\alpha\) for which a solution was found increased by \(17\%\) .  

Interestingly, it is evident from the plots that for both solvers, the “hybrid” variant that switches to uniform updating quickly loses its initial advantage over the purely uniform variant. This exhibits the advantage of giving an SLS solver continuous access to an oracle.  

Since our loss consists of two terms (that we weigh equally in the experiments), an obvious question to ask is whether both of them contribute to the improvement in the performance of the algorithm. In Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 we plot the same statistics as above, however comparing the uniform variant with the full boosted variant, however with the model being trained on only one, the other, and both loss terms. Overall, we find that the combination of the two loss terms produces the best results, however, the Lovász local loss contributes significantly more to the improvement than the Gibbs loss. This is especially surprising for the oracle- based WalkSAT since there is no theoretical result or argument known to the authors that would connect the WalkSAT algorithm to the Lovász Local loss or the conditions in Propositions 2.1 and 2.2. In section A.2 of the appendix, we provide plots with additional details on the experiments.
