Since, GNNs map graphs to graphs, in order to feed a SAT instance into a Graph network, we need to represent it as a graph. Fortunately, there exist various simple graph representations of Boolean formulas. We use the common LCG representation:3 Let \(\phi\) be a SAT formula in CNF form with \(n\) variables \((v_{i})_{i = 1}^{n}\) and \(m\) clauses \((c_{j})_{j = 1}^{m}\) . We introduce a directed tripartite graph \(G = (N,E)\) , consisting of one set \(N_{C}\) of \(m\) nodes, one per constraint, as well as two sets \(N_{V}^{+}\) and \(N_{V}^{- }\) of \(n\) nodes each, one per variable. The initial node embeddings \(\mathbf{n}\) are one- hot encodings for which of these three sets a given node belongs to. The edge set \(E\) further consists of two groups. The first group connects the \(i\) - th node in \(N_{V}^{+}\) with the \(i\) - th node in \(N_{V}^{- }\) , for \(i\in [n]\) . The second group connects, for each clause \(c_{j}\in \phi\) and every variable \(v_{i}\in V^{+}(c_{j})\) , the \(j\) - th node in \(V_{C}\) with the \(i\) - th node in \(N_{V}^{+}\) , and also for every variable \(v_{i}\in V^{- }(c_{j})\) , the \(j\) - th node in

\(V_{C}\) with the \(i\) - th node in \(N_{V}^{- }\) . The initial edge embeddings e are, again, simply one- hot encodings of which of these two groups a given edge falls into. Figure 2 contains a graphical depiction of the LCG representation.
