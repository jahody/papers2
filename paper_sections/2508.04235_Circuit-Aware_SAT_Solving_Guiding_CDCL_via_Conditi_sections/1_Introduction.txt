Circuit Satisfiability (CSAT), a prominent variant of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), is fundamental to numerous critical tasks in Electronic Design Automation (EDA), including Logic Equivalence Checking (LEC) (Goldberg, Prasad, and Brayton 2001) and Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) (Stephan, Brayton, and Sangiovanni- Vincentelli 1996). Traditionally, the prevailing approach to solving CSAT instances involves translating circuit representations into flat Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) formulas and employing Conflict- Driven Clause Learning (CDCL)- based SAT solvers such as Kissat (Armin et al. 2024) and Glucose (Audemard and Simon 2018). CDCL algorithms dynamically determine variable assignments and prune search spaces efficiently (Marques- Silva, Lynce, and Malik 2021). Despite their powerful heuristics and optimization techniques, CNF- based solvers inherently discard crucial structural and functional insights originally embedded  

in circuit representations, often leading to suboptimal performance in practical solving scenarios.  

Recognizing this limitation, recent efforts have focused on leveraging native circuit structures to improve SAT- solving efficiency. However, most existing methods rely on static analysis or preprocessing techniques, such as logic simplifications and structural transformations (Eén, Mishchenko, and Sörensson 2007; Shi et al. 2025c), which lack dynamic guidance during solver execution. Although some learning- based approaches integrate graph embeddings and circuit features directly into SAT solving (Amizadeh, Matusevych, and Weimer 2018; Shi et al. 2023, 2024), they predominantly utilize static graph features and struggle to adapt to evolving solver states. As a result, the dynamic use of circuit- level intelligence in SAT solving remains largely underexplored.  

In this work, we identify the central obstacle to effective circuit- aware SAT solving as the disconnect between static circuit structures and the inherently dynamic nature of CDCL's reasoning process. CDCL solvers operate through a sequence of state- dependent decisions, whereas static circuit analyses typically cannot reflect the solver's evolving needs. To bridge this fundamental gap, we introduce a probabilistic reframing of the CSAT solving problem. Specifically, we posit that the conditional probabilities of unassigned circuit variables, given the solver's prior decisions, directly capture the dynamic essence of CDCL reasoning.  

Based on this key insight, we propose CASCAD (Circuit- Aware SAT Solving via ConditionAI probability- guided Decisions), a novel SAT- solving framework that employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to dynamically estimate gate- level conditional probabilities directly from circuit structures. These probabilities are seamlessly integrated into two essential CDCL heuristics: variable phase selection and clause management (see Figure 1). By guiding these heuristics through real- time probability estimations, CASCAD maintains structural circuit intelligence throughout the solving process, significantly improving solver performance.  

We extensively validate CASCAD on industry- standard EDA benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that probability- guided phase selection alone reduces solving times by up to \(90\%\) on challenging SAT instances derived from logic equivalence checking tasks. Furthermore, by employing a novel probability- based clause filtering strategy, CASCAD

achieves an additional \(23.5\%\) reduction in total solving time on benchmarks from logic equivalence checking scenarios.  

In summary, our primary contributions include:  

- Introducing the first learning-based in-processing heuristics specifically designed for CSAT solving, effectively bridging static circuit representations and the dynamic CDCL solving process.- Developing a highly accurate GNN-based probabilistic model that predicts gate-level conditional probabilities, achieving validation accuracy of \(96.69\%\) .- Demonstrating substantial empirical improvements by integrating the GNN-based conditional probability guidance into state-of-the-art SAT solvers, resulting in significant efficiency gains in real-world EDA applications.  

Our approach not only advances the theoretical understanding of leveraging structural information in SAT solving but also provides a robust framework for future solver enhancements and EDA tool designs.
