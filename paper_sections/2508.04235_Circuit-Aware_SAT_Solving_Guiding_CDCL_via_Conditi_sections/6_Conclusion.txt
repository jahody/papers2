In this work, we propose CASCADE, a novel framework incorporating the inherent circuit information from CSAT instance into dynamic CDCL reasoning. By using a GNN- based model to estimate conditional probabilities of unassigned variable, CASCADE dynamically guides two key CDCL heuristics in the modern SAT solvers: variable phase selection and clause management. Extensive experiments on industry- standard benchmarks demonstrate that CASCADE achieves significant performance gains, reducing solving time by up to \(90\%\) through probability- guided phase selection and achieving an additional \(23.5\%\) reduction via clause filtering in logic equivalence scenarios.
