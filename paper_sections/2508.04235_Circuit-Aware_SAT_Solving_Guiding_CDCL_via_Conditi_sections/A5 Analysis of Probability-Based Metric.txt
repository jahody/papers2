In our probability- based clause filtering method, the solving process is paused once the number of conflicts reaches 50,000, at which point all learnt clauses are extracted. For better analysis, these clauses are grouped according to their LBD values (1, 2, or 3) and further partitioned based on their predicted probabilities. Each group is then re- inserted into the solver independently, allowing us to evaluate their respective impacts on the remainder of the solving process.  

Table A5 presents statistics for the learnt clauses under different LBD levels, further divided by probability thresholds ( \(< 0.8\) and \(\geq 0.8\) ). The table reports the number of clauses in each group, along with the corresponding reductions in solving time and decision count.  

From Table A5, we draw two key conclusions. First, for clauses with the same LBD, retaining those with lower
probability is more beneficial for subsequent solving, even though they are fewer in number. In fact, keeping only high- probability clauses can negatively impact solver performance. Second, we observe that the probability distribution of clauses closely matches the distribution of LBD: among clauses with lower LBD, a larger proportion have low probability. We further find that clause probability is a more informative metric than LBD alone. As a baseline, CaDiCaL simply discards all learnt clauses with LBD greater than 2. However, by filtering \(LBD = 3\) clauses based on probability and retaining only those with low probability, we can still achieve a positive effect on solving performance.
