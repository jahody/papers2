Circuit Satisfiability (CSAT) plays a pivotal role in Electronic Design Automation. The standard workflow for solving CSAT problems converts circuits into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and employs generic SAT solvers powered by Conflict- Driven Clause Learning (CDCL). However, this process inherently discards rich structural and functional information, leading to suboptimal solver performance. To address this limitation, we introduce CASCAD, a novel circuit- aware SAT solving framework that directly leverages circuit- level conditional probabilities computed via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By explicitly modeling gate- level conditional probabilities, CASCAD dynamically guides two critical CDCL heuristics—variable phase selection and clause management—to significantly enhance solver efficiency. Extensive evaluations on challenging real- world Logical Equivalence Checking(LEC) benchmarks demonstrate that CASCAD reduces solving times by up to \(10\times\) compared to state- of- the- art CNF- based approaches, achieving an additional \(23.5\%\) runtime reduction via our probability- guided clause filtering strategy. Our results underscore the importance of preserving circuit- level structural insights within SAT solvers, providing a robust foundation for future improvements in SAT- solving efficiency and EDA tool design.
