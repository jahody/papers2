Function- aware representation learning has become a critical subfield in Electronic Design Automation (EDA), reflecting the broader trend in AI toward learning unified embeddings that can serve multiple downstream tasks. This area can be categorized into two main approaches: predictive models and contrastive models. In predictive models, DeepGate (Shi et al. 2023, 2024; Zheng et al. 2025) and DeepCell (Shi et al. 2025b) leverage asynchronous message passing neural network with representation disentanglement techniques to generate separate embeddings for  

functionality and structure, with pretraining across various EDA benchmarks. PolarGate (Liu et al. 2024) further refines functional embeddings by incorporating ambipolar device principles. In contrastive models, FGNN (Wang et al. 2022, 2024) employs contrastive learning to align circuit embeddings based on functional similarity. Additionally, MGVGA (Wu et al. 2025), CircuitFusion (Fang et al. 2025b), and NetTAG (Fang et al. 2025a) apply contrastive learning across multi- modal circuits to obtain function- invariant embeddings. In this paper, we focus on predicting exact conditional probabilities, for which we choose the state- of- the- art predictive model, DeepGate4, as backbone.
