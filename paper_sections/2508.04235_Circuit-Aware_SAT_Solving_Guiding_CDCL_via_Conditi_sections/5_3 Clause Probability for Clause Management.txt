We validate our clause probability metric using a simple protocol. The solver runs until 50,000 conflicts are reached, after which all learnt clauses are extracted. Our CASCADE- model computes each clause's probability (as defined in Section 3.1) and retains only those below a predefined threshold. We apply this filtering in CaDiCaL with varying thresholds \(\tau\) , and evaluate performance using the PAR- 2 (Par2) score, which penalizes timeouts with twice the cutoff time to reflect both efficiency and robustness.  

We evaluate our probability- guided clause filtering metric on LECUNSAT dataset (150 instances, split into 130 small and 20 hardest cases). Two configurations are compared: (1) the CaDiCaL baseline with mainstream LBD- based metric, and (2) our method with probability- based filtering. Total time includes both solving and model inference time.  

We test thresholds, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, and 0.95, as shown in Figure 5 and Table 5. On 130 small cases, our methods consistently outperform the baseline by solving more instances within the same time limit. For the 20 challenging cases, our methods significantly outperform the baseline even when accounting for inference time.  

These results demonstrate that our filtering method identifies and preserves more useful clauses than the default LBD heuristic (see Appendix A5). The optimal threshold of 0.9 reflects a trade- off: low thresholds yield high- quality but sparse clauses, weakening propagation; high thresholds increase quantity but introduce noise.
