We evaluate the proposed methods (see Section 3.1) in the context of the Logic Equivalence Checking (LEC) task, one of the most critical CSAT problem determining whether two given circuit designs are logically equivalent. All the experiments, including model inference and SAT solving are conducted on an Intel(R) Platinum 8474C.  

Since CDCL SAT solvers exhibit fundamentally different behaviors when solving satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances (Chanseok 2015), we conduct separate evaluations of our proposed probability- based phase selection and clause filtering techniques. For example, solvers favor variable branching heuristics to quickly find satisfying assignments, but rely on advanced clause learning and prune strategies to prove unsatisfiability. To assess the phase selection method, we construct 150 hard satisfiable instances as LECSAT set by applying logic synthesis and minor revisions of different circuits from ForgeEDA dataset (Shi et al. 2025a). Circuit pairs are then combined using miter construction via the ABC tool (Brayton and Mishchenko 2010). These instances have an average solving time of 17.39 seconds using CaDiCaL, ensuring that they are sufficiently challenging. Besides, to evaluate the proposed clause filtering tech  

nique, we construct another set of unsatisfiable instances LECUNSAT by generating miters from pairs of datapath circuits. In these cases, the original circuits are logically equivalent by design, ensuring that the resulting miter circuits are unsatisfiable, which cannot be solved within 20 seconds by CaDiCal.
