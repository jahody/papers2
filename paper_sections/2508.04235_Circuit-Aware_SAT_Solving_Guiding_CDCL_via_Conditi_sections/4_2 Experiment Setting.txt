In the one- round GNN model configuration, both the structural embedding \(h^s\) and the functional embedding \(h^f\) are set to a dimension of 128. The task head, \(\phi\) , has 3 hidden layers with 32 neurons and utilizes the SiLU activation function.  

The model is trained for 60 epochs to ensure convergence with a batch size of 512 using a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. The Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba 2014) is used with a learning rate of \(10^{- 4}\) .
