The Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) is a canonical NP- complete problem that determines whether a given propositional formula is satisfiable. As a variant of SAT, the Circuit Satisfiability Problem (CSAT, Circuit SAT) asks whether there exists an input assignment that makes the output of a given Boolean circuit evaluate to true. Several circuit- based solvers have been developed to address the Circuit SAT problem, aiming to operate directly on circuit format and leverage the structural information. For instance, NIMO (Lu et al. 2003) employs advanced circuit- level Boolean constraint propagation techniques to enhance conflict detection and decision- making. Similarly, Qute- SAT (Wu et al. 2007) incorporates conflict- driven learning strategies optimized for solving complex circuit topologies. Despite these innovations, such solvers generally offer only basic functionality and still fall short of the performance achieved by state- of- the- art CNF- based solvers on large- scale benchmarks.
Modern SAT solvers, such as Kissat (Armin et al. 2024), and CaDiCal (Fleury and Heisinger 2020), have demonstrated remarkable success in handling CNF- based instances. The de- facto standard workflow for solving CSAT problems is to translate circuit into the CNF formulas to be processed by highly- optimized SAT solvers. However, their performance on circuit- based problems is severely bottlenecked by the circuit- to- CNF transformation, which disrupts the structural properties of circuits and produces solver- unfriendly representations. Previous efforts, such as applying EDA- driven circuit optimization techniques (Eén, Mishchenko, and Sörensson 2007; Shi et al. 2025c) and extracting XOR logic on raw circuit (Qian et al. 2025) to reformat the problem into solver- friendly representations before solving, have shown attractive improvements. However, these approaches remain static—they have no impact on solving heuristics and are inactive during the inprocessing phase, a critical period where search decisions and analysis routines are dynamically adjusted. As a result, the rich structural intelligence of circuits remains untapped precisely when it could be most beneficial.
