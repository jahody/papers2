The neural network module takes the hypergraph as input and produces a probability vector \(\mathbf{Y}\) as output, which indicates the probability of each variable taking the truth value. Accordingly, to convert the probability vector \(\mathbf{Y}\) into a Boolean assignment, we transform \(\mathbf{Y}\) into \(n\) Bernoulli distributions, where the \(i\) - th distribution \(B(y_{i})\) is over the discrete values \(\{0,1\}\) . Finally, the node assignments are generated by sampling with the corresponding probability distributions.
