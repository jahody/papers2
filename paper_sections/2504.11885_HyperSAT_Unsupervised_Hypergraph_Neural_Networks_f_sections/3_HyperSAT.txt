In this section, we propose HyperSAT, a neural approach for Weighted MaxSAT problems. Figure 1 illustrates the workflow of HyperSAT. It mainly consists of three modules: the hypergraph modeling module, the neural network module, and the probabilistic mapping module.  

Given a Weighted MaxSAT instance, HyperSAT first applies its hypergraph modeling component to represent the instance as a hypergraph. Then, the hypergraph is solved by the neural network module, which is responsible for processing and optimizing the hypergraph. Finally, through a mapping operation, the probabilistic output of the neural network module is mapped into Boolean values, which serves as a solution to the Weighted MaxSAT instance.  

Note that the uneven weight of clauses increases the nonlinear dependency and sensitivity among variables, the neural network is required to learn how to prioritize the contributions of different clauses. To this end, we propose a specific cross- attention mechanism and introduce an unsupervised multi- objective loss function to capture the logical interplay between the positive and negative literal node representations. These two mechanisms are integrated with the hypergraph convolutional network to form the neural network module of our HyperSAT.
