We evaluate the performance of HyperSAT against baseline algorithms HypOp and (Liu et al., 2023) on various datasets. The primary evaluation metric is the average weighted sum of unsatisfied clauses. The experiments are conducted on datasets with the number of variables ranging from 100 to 250, and the number of clauses varying between 430 and 1065. The results are shown in Table 2.  

As presented in the table, HyperSAT consistently achieves lower values for the average weighted sum of unsatisfied clauses compared to the baseline algorithms (Liu et al., 2023) and HypOp across multiple datasets. For example, on the uf100- 430 dataset, HyperSAT significantly outperforms both baselines with a result of 15.64. This result represents a substantial improvement over the results of (Liu et al., 2023) (32.48) and HypOp (99.15). This trend is observed across all datasets, where HyperSAT always exceeds the

performance of the baselines. The average weight of unsatisfied clauses is reduced by approximately \(50\%\) compared to (Liu et al., 2023) and over \(80\%\) compared to HypOp. On the uf200- 860 and uuf200- 860 datasets, HyperSAT achieves reductions of \(56.99\%\) and \(56.48\%\) compared to (Liu et al., 2023), respectively, and reductions of \(81.71\%\) and \(79.25\%\) compared to HypOp. Similarly, on the uf250- 1065 and uuf250- 1065 datasets, HyperSAT continues to outperform the baselines. The reductions compared to (Liu et al., 2023) are \(57.96\%\) and \(58.38\%\) , respectively, while the reductions compared to HypOp are \(80.52\%\) and \(77.17\%\) . Importantly, even with the larger datasets, HyperSAT maintains or even enhances its efficacy. This demonstrates that HyperSAT scales well and performs better. These results show that HyperSAT consistently provides substantial improvements over both baseline algorithms across a range of datasets, including those with larger problem sizes. As a result, it validates its robustness and effectiveness in reducing the weighted sum of unsatisfied clauses.
