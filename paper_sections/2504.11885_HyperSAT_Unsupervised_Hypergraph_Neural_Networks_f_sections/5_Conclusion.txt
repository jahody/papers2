In this work, we propose HyperSAT, a novel neural approach for Weighted MaxSAT problems, addressing the challenges associated with learning the complex non- linear dependencies and sensitive objective function of this NP- hard problem. By modeling Weighted MaxSAT instances as hypergraphs, a hypergraph convolutional network is introduced as the learning model, coupled with a cross- attention mechanism to capture the logical relationships between positive and negative literals. The proposed framework incorporates an unsupervised multi- objective loss design, which not only optimizes the intrinsic objectives of the Weighted MaxSAT problem but also ensures that the representations of positive and negative literals remain distinct in the feature space.  

Extensive experiments demonstrate the potential of Hyper  

SAT. The experimental results show that HyperSAT is effective in solving Weighted MaxSAT instances and outperforms state- of- the- art competitors in terms of performance. This work offers a fresh perspective on solving the Weighted MaxSAT problem through learning- based methods. Future work will focus on further integrating the model with heuristic solvers, improving the design of well- crafted solvers, and exploring its applications in other complex combinatorial problems.
