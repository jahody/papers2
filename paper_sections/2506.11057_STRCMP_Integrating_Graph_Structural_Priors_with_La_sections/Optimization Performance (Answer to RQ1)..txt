The comparative optimization results are presented in Figure 3 and Table 1 ("CGD" and "ZAM" denotes CoinsGrid and Zamkeller dataset respectively) with respect to primary objective metrics (i.e. PAR- 2 and Number of Timeout for SAT and PD integral for MILP domains). Comprehensive results for all evaluation metrics are provided in Appendix G.1). As evidenced in Figure 3 and Table 1, our STRCMP with various post- training variants consistently matches or exceeds all baseline performance across both SAT and MILP domains. Specifically for SAT, STRCMP demonstrates universal superiority over its closest counterpart AutoSAT, particularly achieving significant reductions in terms of timeout (77.8% on Zamkeller: \(18 \rightarrow 4\) ; 66.7% on PRP: \(9 \rightarrow 3\) ) and solving time (on PRP: 22967 seconds \(\rightarrow 21146\) seconds; on Zamkeller: 20772 seconds \(\rightarrow 6929\) seconds). On MILP benchmarks, STRCMP maintains strong performance parity with NCO methods L2B/HEM and its direct competitor LLM4Solver. These

empirical findings conclusively address RQ1: STRCMP successfully identifies superior algorithmic configurations compared to existing strong baselines.
