MILP Solver. In all experiments related to MILP domain, we employ SCIP 8.0.0 [52] as the MILP solver backend—a leading open- source solver widely adopted in machine learning research for combinatorial optimization [44, 53]. To ensure reproducibility and fair comparisons, all SCIP parameters remain at default values. We retain the solver's advanced features (e.g., presolve, heuristics), aligning our experimental setup with real- world applications.  

SAT Solver. In all experiments related to SAT domain, we use EasySAT \(^5\) to ensure direct comparability with AutoSAT[29]. The solver incorporates modern Conflict- Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) techniques including Literal Block Distance (LBD) heuristics, and VSIDS variable selection, and conflict- driven clause learning. All configurations (compiler versions, interfaces, time budgets) maintain parity with [29] for reproducibility.
