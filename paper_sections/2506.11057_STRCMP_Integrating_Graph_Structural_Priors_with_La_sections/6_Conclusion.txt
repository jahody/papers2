We propose STRCMP, a novel structure- aware LLM- based algorithm discovery framework for combinatorial optimization problems. To our knowledge, this represents the first methodology that explicitly incorporates structural priors of combinatorial optimization problems into LLM- driven algorithm discovery, simultaneously enhancing solution quality and computational efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of STRCMP through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations across SAT and MILP problems, demonstrating consistent improvements in both solving efficiency and solution optimality. Our framework offers a principled foundation for future research integrating additional modal priors into LLMs for solving combinatorial optimization problems.
