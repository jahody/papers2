The proposed framework is illustrated in Figure 2. We first describe the technical interplay among components within the proposed framework, highlighting design motivations and synergistic interactions. Subsequently, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that integrating structural priors into LLMs enhances performance in solving combinatorial optimization problems.
