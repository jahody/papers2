To empirically evaluate the efficacy of our proposed STRCMP in solving combinatorial optimization problems, we conduct extensive experiments across two fundamental CO problem classes: mixed- integer linear programming and Boolean satisfiability, evaluated on over nine benchmark datasets. We benchmark our approach against five well- established baselines encompassing both neural optimization methods and contemporary LLM- based approaches. We aim to answer the following research questions:
