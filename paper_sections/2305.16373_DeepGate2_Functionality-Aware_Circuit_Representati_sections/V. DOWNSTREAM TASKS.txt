In this section, we combine our DeepGate2 with the open- source EDA tools and apply our model to practical EDA tasks: logic synthesis and Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving. The logic synthesis tools aim to identify logic equivalence gates as quickly as possible. In Section V- A, our proposed functionality- aware circuit learning model provides guidance to the logic synthesis tool about the logic similarity. Additionally, in Section V- B, we apply the learnt functional similarity in SAT solving, where the variables with dissimilar functionality are assigned the same decision value. This approach efficiently shrinks the search space by enabling solvers to encounter more constraints.
