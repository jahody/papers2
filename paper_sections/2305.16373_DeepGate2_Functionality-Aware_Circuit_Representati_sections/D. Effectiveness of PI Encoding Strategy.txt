To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PI encoding (PIE) strategy, we trained another model without assigning unique identifications for PIs, which we refer to as w/o PIE. The results are presented in Table III, which show that disabling the PIE reduces the F1- Score of identifying logic equivalence gates from 0.9434 to 0.7541, resulting in an average reduction of \(20.07\%\) .  

Such reduction can be attributed to the fact that, as demonstrated as the failure case in Section II and Fig. 1, the one- round GNN model without the PIE strategy cannot model the structural information of the circuit. More specifically, the accuracy of the reconvergence structure identification task with w/ PIE model is \(93.22\%\) , while the w/o model only achieve \(74.56\%\) . The functionality of logic gate is affected by both functionality of fan- in gates and whether there is reconvergence between its fan- in gates. Once the reconvergence structure cannot be accurately identified, node functionality cannot be modeled accurately.
