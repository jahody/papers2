A prominent trend in the deep learning community is to learn a general representation from data first and then apply it to various downstream tasks, for example, GPT [16] and BERT [17] learn representations of natural language text that can be fine- tuned for a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Circuit representation learning has also emerged as an attractive research direction, which falls into two categories: structure- aware circuit representation learning [9], [11], [12] and functionality- aware circuit representation learning [7], [8].  

Since a circuit can be naturally formulated as a graph, with gates as nodes and wires as edge, the GNN is a powerful tool to capture the interconnections of logic gates and becomes a backbone model to learn circuit representations. For example, TAG [9] is a GNN- based model designed for analog and mixed- signal circuit representation learning and applied for several physical design applications, such as layout matching prediction, wirelength estimation, and net parasitic capacitance prediction. ABGNN [12] learns the representation of digital circuits and handles the arithmetic block identification task. However, these models tend to focus on structural encoding and are not suitable for functionality- related tasks.  

Consequently, the functionality- aware circuit representation learning frameworks [7], [8] are designed to learn the underlying circuit functionality. For instance, FGNN [8] learns to distinguishes between functionally equivalent and inequivalent circuits by contrastive learning [18]. However, such self- supervised manner relies on data augmentation by perturbing the original circuit to logic equivalence circuit. If the perturbation is not strong and diverse, the model still identifies the functional equivalence circuits based on the invariant local structure, resulting a low generalization ability on capturing underlying functionality. DeepGate [7] leverages logic- 1 probability under random simulation as supervision, which approximates the statistic of the most direct representation of functionality, i.e. truth table. Despite achieving remarkable progress on testability analysis [5], there are limitations that affect the generalizability of DeepGate to other EDA tasks. We will elaborate on DeepGate in the next subsection.
