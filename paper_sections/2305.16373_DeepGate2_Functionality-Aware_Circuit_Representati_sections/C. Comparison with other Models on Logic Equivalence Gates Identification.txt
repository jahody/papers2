This section compares the functionality- aware accuracy, as defined in Section IV- A2 of DeepGate2 with that of two other models: DeepGate [7] and FGNN [8]. The DeepGate [7] model treats the logic probability as supervision since it contains the statistical information of truth table. The FGNN [8] is trained to differentiate between logic equivalent and inequivalent circuits using contrastive learning.  

Table II presents the performance of three models on the task of logic equivalence gates identification. Firstly, our proposed approach outperforms the other two models on all circuits with an average F1- score of 0.9434, while DeepGate and FGNN only achieve F1- Score 0.6778 and 0.4402, respectively. For instance, in circuit D7, our proposed functionality- aware circuit learning approach achieves an F1- Score of 0.9831 and accurately identifies \(99.15\%\) of logic equivalence gate pairs with a precision of \(97.48\%\) , indicating a low false positive rate. In contrast, DeepGate only achieves an F1- score of 0.6778, while FGNN fails on most of the pairs. Secondly, although DeepGate has an average recall of \(91.46\%\) , its precision is only \(54.00\%\) , indicating a large number of false positive identifications. This is because DeepGate can only identify logic equivalent pairs by predicting logic probability, which leads to incorrect identification of gate pairs with similar logic probability. According to our further experiment, in \(80.83\%\) of false positive pairs, the model incorrectly identifies gate pairs with similar logic probability as functionally equivalent. Thirdly, FGNN achieves the lowest performance among the other models, with only 0.4402 F1- Score. The poor performance of FGNN is attributed to the lack of effective supervision. While FGCN learns to identify logic equivalence circuits generated by perturbing local structures slightly, the model tends to consider circuits with similar structures to have the same functionality. However, in the validation dataset and practical applications, two circuits may have the same function even if their topological structures are extremely different. Therefore, the self- supervised approach limits the effectiveness of FGNN in identifying logic equivalence gates.
