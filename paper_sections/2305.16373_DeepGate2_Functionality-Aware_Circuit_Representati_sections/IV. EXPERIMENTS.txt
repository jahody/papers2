In this section, we demonstrate the ability of our proposed DeepGate2 to learn functionality- aware circuit representations. Firstly, Section IV- A provides the preliminary of our experiments, including details on dataset preparation, evaluation metrics and model settings. Secondly, we compare the effectiveness and efficiency of our DeepGate2 against DeepGate [7] and FGNN [8] on two function- related tasks: logic probability prediction (see Section IV- B) and logic equivalence gates identification (see Section IV- C). Thirdly, we investigate the effectiveness of model design and training strategies in Section IV- D and Section IV- E, respectively.
