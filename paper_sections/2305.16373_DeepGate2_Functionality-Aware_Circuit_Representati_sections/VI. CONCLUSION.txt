This paper introduces DeepGate2, a novel functionally- aware framework for circuit representation learning. Our approach leverages the pairwise truth table differences of logic gates as a supervisory signal, providing rich functionality supervision and proving scalable for large circuits. Moreover, DeepGate2 differentiates and concurrently updates structural and functional embeddings in two dedicated flows, acquiring comprehensive representations through a single round of GNN forward message- passing. In comparison to its predecessor, DeepGate2 demonstrates enhanced performance in logic probability prediction and logic equivalent gate identification, while simultaneously improving model efficiency tenfold. The applications of DeepGate2 onto multiple downstream tasks further demonstrate its effectiveness and potential utility in the EDA field.
