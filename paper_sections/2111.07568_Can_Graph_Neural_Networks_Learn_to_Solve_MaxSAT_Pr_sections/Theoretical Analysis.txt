With the results and prospects revealed in practice, GNNs are considered to be a suitable choice in learning to solve SAT problem from benchmarks. However, the knowledge about why these models would work from a theoretical perspective is still limited so far. In this section, we are committed to explaining the possible mechanism of GNNs to solve MaxSAT problem. More specifically, we prove that a single- layer GNN can achieve an approximation ratio of \(1 / 2\) with the help of a distributed local algorithm.
