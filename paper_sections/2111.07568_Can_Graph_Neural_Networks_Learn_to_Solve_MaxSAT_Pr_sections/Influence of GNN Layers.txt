According to the theoretical analysis, the number of GNN layers determines the information that each node can receive from its neighborhood, thereby affecting the accuracy of prediction. We examine this phenomenon from the experimental perspective by training MS- NSFG and MS- ESFG on the three datasets separately, with different hyper- parameter \(T\) from 1 to 30. The changes of accuracy on testing sets are illustrated in Figure 4. It can be seen that when \(T = 1\) , the capabilities of both models are weak, where the predicted objective is far from the optimal value, and the accuracy of assignments is not ideal. However, the effectiveness of both models has been significantly improved when \(T = 5\) . If we increase \(T\) to 20, the number of clauses satisfied by the predicted solution is only one less than the optimal value on average. We have continued to increase \(T\) to 60, but no obvious improvement occurred. This indicates that increasing the number of layers - within an appropriate range - will improve the capability of GNN models.
