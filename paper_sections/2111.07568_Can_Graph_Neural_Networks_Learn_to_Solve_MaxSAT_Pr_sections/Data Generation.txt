For data- driven approaches, a large number of labeled instances are necessary. So, the dataset should be easy to solve by off- the- shelf MaxSAT solvers to ensure the size of dataset, meanwhile it should also have the ability to produce larger instances in the same distribution to test the generalization. As a result, we construct the datasets of random MaxSAT instances by running a generator proposed by (Mitchell, Selman, and Levesque 1992), which is also used to provide benchmarks for the random track of MaxSAT competitions<sup>1</sup>. The generator can produce CNF formulas with three parameters: the number of literals in each clause \(k\) , the number of variables \(n\) , and the number of clauses \(m\) .  

In order to better observe the performance of GNN models, we generate multiple datasets with different distributions, which are listed in Table 1. For R2 (60, 600), R2 (60, 800) and R3 (30, 300), we generate 20K instances, and divide them into training set, validation set and testing set according to the ratio of 8:1:1. For R2 (80, 800) and R3 (50, 500), we only generate 2K instances as testing sets. Then we call MaxHS (Bacchus 2020), a state- of- the- art MaxSAT solver, to find an optimal solution for each instance as the labels of variables. The average time MaxHS spends to solve the instances in each dataset is also presented, so that we can know about their difficulty.
