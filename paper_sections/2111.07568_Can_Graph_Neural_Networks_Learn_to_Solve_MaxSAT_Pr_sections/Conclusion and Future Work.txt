Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been considered as a promising technique that can learn to solve combinatorial problems in the data- driven fashion, especially for the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem. In this paper, we further study the quality of solution predicted by GNNs in learning to solve Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem, both from theoretical and practical perspectives. Based on the graph construction methods in the previous work, we build two kinds of GNN models, MS- NSFG and MS- ESFG, which can predict the solution of MaxSAT problem. The models are trained and tested on randomly generated benchmarks with different distributions. The experimental results show that both models have achieved pretty high accuracy, and also satisfactory generalization to larger and more difficult instances. In addition, this paper is the first that attempts to present an explanation of the capability of GNNs to solve MaxSAT problem from a theoretical point of view. On the basis of algorithmic alignment theory, we prove that even a single- layer GNN model can solve the MaxSAT problem with an approximation ratio of \(1 / 2\) .  

We hope the results in this paper can inspire future work from multiple perspectives. A promising direction is to integrate the GNN models into a powerful search framework to handle more difficult problems in the specific domain, such as weighted and partial MaxSAT problems. It is also interesting to further analyze the theoretical capability of multilayer GNNs to achieve better approximation.
