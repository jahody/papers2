According to the algorithmic alignment theory, it is possible to reasonably infer the capability that a GNN model can achieve with the help of an algorithm aligned with its computational structure. However, this also raises an issue: as a polynomial- time procedure, any GNN model cannot align with an exact algorithm for NP- hard problems such as MaxSAT, under the assumption that \(\mathrm{P} \neq \mathrm{NP}\) . In this case, we turn to employ a weaker approximation algorithm to analyze the capability of GNNs. Although there has been a lot of research on the approximation algorithms of MaxSAT (Vazirani 2001), it is regrettable that most of them cannot align with the structure of GNNs in an intuitive way.  

In fact, there is a class of algorithms called distributed local algorithm (DLA) (Elkin 2004), which have been found to be a good choice to align with GNNs for combinatorial problems. DLA assumes a distributed computing system that there are a set of nodes in a graph, where any two nodes do not know the existence of each other at first. The algorithm then runs in a constant number of synchronous communication rounds. In each round, a node performs local computation, and sends one message to its neighboring nodes, while  

Algorithm 1: A distributed local algorithm for MaxSAT  Input: The set of literals \(L\) , the set of clauses \(C\)  Output: The assignments of literals \(\Phi\) 1: Set up a factor graph such as NSFG for \(L\) and \(C\) . 2: \(W(L_i) \leftarrow 0\) for each \(L_i \in L\) . 3: \(S(C_j) \leftarrow \{\}\) for each \(C_j \in C\) . 4: \(S(C_j) \leftarrow S(C_j) \cup \{L_i\}\) for each edge \((L_i, C_j)\) in the factor graph. 5: for each \(C_j \in C\) do 6: \(L^* \leftarrow\) Pick a literal from \(S(C_j)\) . 7: \(W(L^*) \leftarrow W(L^*) + 1\) . 8: end for 9: for each \(L_i \in L\) do 10: if \(W(L_i) > = W(\bar{L}_i)\) then 11: \(\Phi (L_i) \leftarrow \mathrm{True}\) . 12: else 13: \(\Phi (L_i) \leftarrow \mathrm{False}\) . 14: end if 15: end for 16: return \(\Phi\)  

receiving one from each of them. Finally, each node computes the output in terms of the information it holds. DLAs have been widely used in many applications, such as designing sublinear- time algorithms (Parnas and Ron 2007) and controlling wireless sensor networks (Kubisch et al. 2003).
