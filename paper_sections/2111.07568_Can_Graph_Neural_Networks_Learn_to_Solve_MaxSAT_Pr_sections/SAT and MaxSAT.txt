Given a set of Boolean variables \(\{x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots , x_{n}\}\) , a literal is either a variable \(x_{i}\) or its negation \(\neg x_{i}\) . A clause is a disjunction of literals, such as \(C_{1} \coloneqq x_{1} \vee \neg x_{2} \vee x_{3}\) . A propositional logic formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) is a conjunction of clauses, such as \(F \coloneqq C_{1} \wedge C_{2} \wedge C_{3}\) .  

For a CNF formula \(F\) , the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem is to find a truth assignment for each variable, such that all the clauses are satisfied (i.e., at least one literal in each clause is True). And the Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem is to find a truth assignment for each variable, such that the number of satisfied clauses is maximized. SAT and MaxSAT have long been proved to be NP- hard, which means there is no polynomial- time algorithm to solve them unless \(\mathrm{P} = \mathrm{NP}\) . Specifically, if every clause in \(F\) contains exactly \(k\) literals, the problem is called '\(k\) SAT' or 'Max\(k\) SAT'.  

There is a close relationship between MaxSAT and SAT. Firstly, MaxSAT can be seen as an optimization version of SAT, which can provide more information when handling over- constrained problems. Besides, many solving techniques that are effective in SAT have also been adapted
to MaxSAT, such as lazy data structures and variable selection heuristics. Accordingly, SAT can also benefit from the progress of MaxSAT.
