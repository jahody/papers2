Although the GNN models have shown their capability on many reasoning tasks such as SAT problem, the experimental evidence of whether GNNs can learn to solve MaxSAT problem is still under exploration. In order to demonstrate the capability of GNNs on this task, we firstly build two models, using NSFG and ESFG separately. After constructing the datasets with a commonly used generator for random MaxSAT instances, the GNN models are trained and tested in different settings, so that we can obtain a comprehensive understanding of their capabilities. The experimental results show that GNNs have attractive potential in learning to solve MaxSAT problem with good performance and generalization.
