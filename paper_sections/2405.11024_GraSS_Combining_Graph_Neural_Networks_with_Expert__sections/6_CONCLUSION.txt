This work proposed a novel supervised approach to SAT solver selection, based on representing instances as literal- clause graphs and training a graph neural network to select, from this representation, a SAT solver among a fixed portfolio so as to minimize solving runtime. The graph representations are endowed with node features that encode domain knowledge, and in the case of clause nodes, also position within the SAT formula. The resulting scheme is shown to outperform competing approaches on two benchmarks, one from an industrial circuit design application and one from the annual SAT solver competitions.
