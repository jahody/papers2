More generally, SAT solver selection is a special case of algorithm selection, which aims to select, for a given input, the most efficient algorithm from a set of candidate algorithms. This is particularly important for computationally hard problems, where there is typically no single algorithm that outperforms all others for all inputs. Besides SAT solving, algorithm selection techniques have achieved remarkable success in various applications such as Answer Set Programming (ASP) [15] and the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) [1]. A thorough literature review is provided in Kerschke et al. [25].  

Algorithm selection methods can be roughly divided between offline and online methods. Offline methods, such as this work, rely on training ahead of time on a labeled dataset, whereas online algorithms attempt to improve selection performance as more and more cases are run. Although providing worse initial performance, online methods avoid the computational cost of the initial training phase and the problem of distribution shift between training and test data, and methods based on based on reinforcement learning or multi- armed bandits have been proposed for this purpose [10, 15].  

The many design choices in algorithm selection systems pose new challenges for efficient system development. For example, AutoFolio [30] automatically configures the entire framework, including budget allocation for pre- solving schedules, pre- processing procedures (such as transformations and filtering) and algorithm component selection. It achieved competitive performance in multiple scenarios from the ASLib [4] benchmark.
