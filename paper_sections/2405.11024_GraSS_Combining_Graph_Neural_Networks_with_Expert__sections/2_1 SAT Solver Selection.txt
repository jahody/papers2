There exists a rich literature describing machine learning models for the selection of the optimal SAT solver for a given instance. This approach is sometimes referred to as portfolio- based SAT solving. A detailed summary is provided by Holden et al. [20, Section 6].  

SATzilla [46] and its successors [45, 47] are a family of classification models that have won multiple prizes in the SAT Competition (2007 and 2009) and the SAT Challenge (2012). SATzilla uses hand- selected features to characterize each SAT instance for best solver selection. The latest version of SATzilla [45] consists of a feature
cost classifier to predict if the entire set of features can be computed within a time threshold and an algorithm selector for instances with feature cost less or equal to this threshold. Whereas the first version [46] applies ridge regression, the latest version [45] uses a cost- sensitive decision tree for the algorithm selection model.  

In addition to the SATzilla family, hand- picked features have also been used with \(k\) - nearest neighbor or clustering methods to select the best algorithm [23, 32, 34]. CSHC [32] uses a cost- sensitive hierarchical clustering algorithm to iteratively partition the feature space into clusters in a supervised top- down fashion. In combination with the static algorithm schedule of 3S [23], it achieved better performance than SATzilla in the 2011 SAT Competition. ArgoS- mArT [34] uses a combination of a \(k\) - Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model and a multi- armed bandit algorithm. The KNN performs solver selection based on the nearest instance to the queried instance in a metric space.  

Finally, Loreggia et al. [31] proposed a deep learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). They take textual representations of SAT instances in a standard format, and convert them into grayscale images by replacing each character with its corresponding ASCII code. These images are then rescaled to \(128 \times 128\) pixels, and fed to a CNN, which is trained to predict the fastest solver in the pool. Although employing deep learning, this approach is not lossless, as the rescaling required by the CNN architecture leads to information loss, unlike our approach.
