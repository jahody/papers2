Our SAT solver selection problem can be formally described as follows. We have a fixed pool of SAT solvers \(S_{1}, \ldots , S_{K}\) and a SAT instance \(a\) , and we must select a solver so as to solve the instance in the smallest runtime possible.

Edges are drawn between clauses and literal nodes if the literal participate in the clause, and edges are also drawn between positive and negative nodes of the same variable. The nodes are endowed with feature vectors described in Appendix A. </center>  

To do so, at train- time, we are given a collection of SAT instances and for each instance \(a_{i}\) , we are given sampled solving times \(t_{i}^{1},\dots,t_{i}^{K}\) from each solver. This dataset can be used for training a machine learning model offline in a supervised manner. At test- time, a separate collection of SAT instances are given to the model, which selects a solver for each. The selected solver for each instance is run, and the average runtime over all testing instances is used to benchmark performance of the selector model.
