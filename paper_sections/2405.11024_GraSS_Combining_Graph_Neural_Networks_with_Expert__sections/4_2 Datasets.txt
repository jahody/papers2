We train and evaluate on two datasets.  

Logic Equivalence Checking (LEC). This is a proprietary dataset generated from logic equivalence checking steps in electronic circuit design. Circuits undergo a large number of optimization steps during logic synthesis, and at each one of the steps, it is necessary to verify that the circuits before and after optimization are functionally equivalent. This is done by verifying that the two circuits produce the same outputs for all possible inputs, which is equivalent to solving a SAT problem [17, 21]. We collected logic equivalence checks from the optimization of 30 industrial circuits, yielding a total of 78,727 SAT instances. A summary of dataset statistics is provided as Table 1a.  

SAT Competition (SC). This is a subset of the Anniversary Track Benchmark of the 2022 SAT Competition [2], which itself was created by collecting all instances from the Main, Crafted and Application tracks of the previous SAT competitions up to that year. We ran each instance of the Anniversary benchmark through each of the seven solvers in the portfolio, and excluded those that could not be solved within 1,500 seconds by any solver, as well as those with more than 20,000 variables, yielding 2,088 SAT instances. A summary of dataset statistics is provided as Table 1b.
