The Forman- Ricci Curvature (FC) is a discretization of Ricci curvature that holds for a broad class of topological objects, namely so called (regular) cellular (CW) complexes [44]. The original definition [18] is both extremely technical and out of the scope of this paper. Given that graphs edges are 1- dimensional cells (topologically), the definition simplifies greatly making use of very simple graph properties. Consider a simple, unweighted graph for simplicity, then the FC of edge \((i,j)\) is defined as \(\kappa_{G}^{f}(i,j) = 4 - d_{i} - d_{j}\) . The main issue of this definition is that it ignores higher order correlations in terms of triangles and 4- cycles, which prove crucial to discriminate positively, flat, and negatively curved graphs. Inspired by these issues, Topping et al. [47] propose an extension of the FC dubbed Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), such that it is both fast to compute and encodes accurate curvature information.  

Let us start by defining the sphere and ball of radius \(r\) centered at a node \(i\) of the graph by:  

\[S_{r}(i) \coloneqq \{j \in V: d_{G}(i,j) = r\} , \quad B_{r}(i) \coloneqq \{j \in V: d_{G}(i,j) \leq r\} . \quad (15)\]  

The BFC is then defined using three combinatorial components:  

(i) \(\sharp_{\Delta}(i,j)\) , the number of triangles based at the edge \(i \sim j\) .  

(ii) \(\sharp_{\square}^{i}(i,j) \coloneqq\) , the number of nodes \(k \in S_{1}(i)\) forming a 4- cycle based at \(i \sim j\) without diagonals inside.  

(iii) \(Q_{i}(j) \coloneqq S_{1}(i) \setminus (\{j\} \cup \sharp_{\Delta}(i,j) \cup \sharp_{\square}^{i}(i,j))\) , simply the complement of the neighbours of \(i\) with respect to the sets introduced in (i) and (ii) once we also exclude \(j\) .  

Definition A.2 (Topping et al. [47]). For any edge \(i \sim j\) in a simple, unweighted graph \(G = (V, E)\) with adjacency matrix \(A\) let:  

\(S_{1}(i) \coloneqq \{j \in V: i \sim j \in E\}\) be the set of 1- hop neighbors of \(i\) .  

\(\sharp_{\Delta}(i,j) \coloneqq S_{1}(i) \cap S_{1}(j)\) be the set of triangles based at \(i \sim j\) .  

\(\sharp_{\square}^{i}(i,j) \coloneqq \{k \in S_{1}(i) \setminus S_{1}(j), k \neq j: \exists w \in (S_{1}(k) \cap S_{1}(j)) \setminus S_{1}(i)\}\) be the neighbors of \(i\) forming a 4- cycle based at \(i \sim j\) without diagonals inside.  

\(\gamma_{\max}(i,j) \coloneqq \max \left\{\max_{k \in \sharp_{\square}^{i}} \{(A_{k} \cdot (A_{j} - A_{i} \odot A_{j})) - 1\} , \max_{w \in \sharp_{\square}^{i}} \{(A_{w} \cdot (A_{i} - A_{j} \odot A_{i})) - 1\} \right\}\) , with \(\cdot\) being the dot product and \(\odot\) the elementwise product, be the maximal number of 4- cycles based at \(i \sim j\) traversing a common node.  

The BFC \(Ric(i,j)\) is zero if \(\min \{d_{i}, d_{j}\} = 1\) and alternatively:  

\[R i c(i,j) \coloneqq \frac{2}{d_{i}} + \frac{2}{d_{j}} -2 + 2\frac{|\sharp_{\Delta}(i,j)|}{\max \{d_{i},d_{j}\}} +\frac{|\sharp_{\Delta}(i,j)|}{\min \{d_{i},d_{j}\}} +\frac{(\gamma_{m a x}(i,j))^{-1}}{\max \{d_{i},d_{j}\}} (|\sharp_{\square}^{i}| + |\sharp_{\square}^{j}|). \quad (16)\]
