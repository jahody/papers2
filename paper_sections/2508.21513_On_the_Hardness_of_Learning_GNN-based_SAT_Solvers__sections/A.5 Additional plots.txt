In this section we provide additional and miscellaneous plot that help with visualizing various concepts explained in the main manuscript, such as the relationship between curvature and hardness, as well as visualizations of easy and hard problems. More details can be found in Figures 4, 5, 6 and 7.
<center>Figure 6: Visualization of a hard, in terms of clause density \(\alpha\) , random 3-SAT problem with 256 variables in (a) bipartite and (b) circular layouts. There is a very large number of long-range interactions, as can clearly be seen in (b). Furthermore, for such large \(\alpha\) , the average BFC is strongly negative, in line with the developed theory. </center>  

<center>Figure 7: Average BFC as a function of \(\alpha\) for random 3 and 4 -SAT problems with \(N = 256\) . The size of the blobs is used as a representation for the average solvability of the problems at a given \(\alpha\) by the NeuroSAT model [46]. The vertical red line represents the analytical SAT-UNSAT critical threshold \(\alpha_{c}\) [32]. The average BFC drops monotonically with \(\alpha\) in both cases. For 3-SAT (a), this drop appears to be almost linear, with a substantial amount of variance, as also depicted in Figure 2. 4-SAT on the other hand contains problems where the curvature is substantially more negative and concentrated, which when coupled with the larger number of constraints leads to oversquashing, as discussed in our theory. This can be clearly seen by the fast performance drop-off in (b), which happens much earlier than \(\alpha_{c}\) , indicating the additional hardness phase related to representation learning discussed in the main paper. </center>
<center>Figure 8: Analogue of Figure 2a for 4-SAT. Average BFC as a function of \(\alpha\) for random 4-SAT problems with \(N = 256\) . The color is used as a representation for the average solvability of the problems at a given \(\alpha\) by the NeuroSAT model, with a group labeled as solvable if \(50\%\) or more of the problems get a satisfying assignment. The vertical red line represents the analytical SAT-UNSAT critical threshold \(\alpha_{c} \approx 9.931\) [32]. The average BFC is negative and drops with \(\alpha\) , but for a small amount. The plot in the top-right corner shows the model's solution probability curve as a function of \(\alpha\) , where it is possible to notice that the GNN-based solver has severe limitations on these problems. Differently from 3-SAT (Figure 2a), the average curvature is negative and concentrated even for problems that would be considered very simple in terms of \(\alpha\) ( \(\alpha \rightarrow 8\) ). This is due to the larger value of \(k\) , the higher number of long-range interactions, and the connection of both factors with oversquashing, as discussed and predicted by our contributions. </center>
