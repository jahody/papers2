In Riemannian geometry, RC quantifies the local deviation of a manifold \(\mathcal{M}\) from flat Euclidean space, as a result of the metric defined on \(\mathcal{M}\) . Intuitively, RC captures how the neighborhoods of two adjacent points relate when moving from one point to the other. On smooth manifolds, it compares how a small ball of mass around a point is distorted when transported along a geodesic to a neighboring point. Extending this notion to more general structures, such as metric spaces or combinatorial complexes, has been an extremely active area of mathematical research, with the works of Ollivier [39] and Forman [18] standing out. In the case of graphs, we ask ourselves how local connectivity either concentrates or disperses. Ollivier [39] implements this idea by comparing probability mass on local neighborhoods, i.e., a random walk distribution on the endpoints of an edge. Given these two distributions, one can compare the ratio between their Wasserstein and shortest path distance, serving as a direct and discrete analogue of geodesic transport. See Appendix A.1.1 for more details. The definition of Forman [18] relies heavily on topology, and thus it takes a combinatorial form. Essentially, given a cell complex, the curvature of a p- cell depends only on the topological structures between the cell and its neighbors. This makes Forman- Ricci Curvature (FC) simpler to compute numerically, since it can avoid the optimization of the optimal transport problem that arises in Ollivier- Ricci Curvature (OC) curvature.  

Given that RC is directly related to the structure of local neighborhoods, it has emerged as a powerful way of theoretically analyzing limitations of GNNs. In a seminal paper, Topping et al. [47] provide both a balanced version of the FC curvature and show that the oversquashing problem [1] can be directly connected to edges with high negative curvature. This definition, namely the BFC, is central to this paper, therefore please consult Appendix A.1.2 for the definition and additional details. Nguyen et al. [38] have shown that similar results can be derived using the OC curvature. It is worth noting that these notions of curvature are naturally correlated with one another, as shown empirically in a multitude of complex networks by Samal et al. [44].
