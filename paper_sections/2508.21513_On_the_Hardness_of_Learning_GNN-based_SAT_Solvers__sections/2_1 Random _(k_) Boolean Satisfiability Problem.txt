The random \(k\) - SAT (assignment) problem, which is the central object of study in this work, is made up of \(N\) variables \(\{x_{i}\}_{i = 1}^{N}\) that can take binary values \(x_{i} \in \{0,1\}\) . Using these variables, one constructs \(M\) clauses containing a disjunction of \(k\) variables or their negations (called literals). For example, a 3- SAT problem would have clauses of the form \((x_{i} \vee \neg x_{j} \vee x_{h})\) . The goal is to assign a value to all literals such that they satisfy the conjunction of all clauses. This logical formula is called a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). In the random formulation, it is possible to identify different phases of problem hardness based on a parameter called the clause density \(\alpha = M / N\) . This phenomenon has been actively researched in statistical physics due to the analogies between random \(k\) - SAT and spin- glass models [33, 34]. Notable results[26, 37, 50] include the discovery of two transitions for typical instances at a given \(k\) , based on the value of \(\alpha\) in the thermodynamic limit \((M, N \to \infty)\) : As \(\alpha\) increases, the measure over the space of possible solutions first decomposes into an exponential number of clusters at the dynamical transition \(\alpha_{d}(k)\) and subsequently condensates over the largest such states at the critical transition \(\alpha_{c}(k)\) . These phase transitions naturally affect the performances of many algorithms, e.g., when \(k \geq 4\) , going beyond \(\alpha_{c}\) is almost impossible with existing algorithms.
