To make the discrete program continuous, we first allow the value of the variables \(y_{i}\) to be any real number between \(- 1\) and 1. However, semidefinite programming goes further and allows variables to be \((n + 1)\) - dimensional unit vectors \((y_{0},\ldots ,y_{n})\longrightarrow (\mathbf{y}_{0},\ldots ,\mathbf{y}_{n})\) , as schematically depicted in Figure 7. In this relaxation, the binary products \(y_{i}\cdot y_{j}\) in the objective function are replaced by inner products \(\langle \mathbf{y}_{i},\mathbf{y}_{j}\rangle\)  

This can be compactly represented in matrix form by substituting each inner product \(\langle \mathbf{y}_{i},\mathbf{y}_{j}\rangle\) with a scalar \(Y_{ij}\) of a matrix \(Y\) . The fact that these scalars correspond to inner products is encoded by the restriction to positive- semidefinite matrices \(Y\succeq 0\) . The SDP relaxation of MAX- 2- SAT can thus be formulated as:  

\[\begin{array}{rl} & {\mathrm{Maximize:}\quad \mathrm{Tr}(W Y)}\\ & {\mathrm{Subject~to:}\quad Y_{i i} = 1\mathrm{~for~all~}i\in \{0,1,\ldots ,n\}}\\ & {\qquad Y\succeq 0} \end{array} \quad (27)\]  

Positive semidefiniteness of matrix \(Y\) ensures that it can be uniquely factorized as \(Y =\) \(Y^{\frac{1}{2}}(Y^{\frac{1}{2}})^{T}\) . We can then obtain real unit vectors \(\mathbf{y}_{i}\) for all \(i\in \{0,\ldots ,n\}\) such that \(Y_{ij} = \langle \mathbf{y}_{i},\mathbf{y}_{j}\rangle\) for all \(i,j\in \{0,\ldots ,n\}\) . The constraints \(Y_{ii} = 1\) ensure that all vectors \(\mathbf{y}_{i}\) lie on an \((n + 1)\) - dimensional unit sphere.  

<center>Figure 7: Lifting the variables to a higher dimension, demonstrated on variables \(y_{1},y_{2},y_{3}\) . Initially, only integer values of \(-1\) and 1 could be assigned to them (integer program). Next, constraints are relaxed, allowing variables to take any real value between \(-1\) and 1. Finally, it is permitted for them to be unit vectors in a high-dimensional space (here, 3 dimensions). The hyperplane in the last picture would be used for rounding the variables at the end. This hyperplane can be randomly selected, and truth values for variables \(y_{1},y_{2},y_{3}\) are determined based on which side of the hyperplane they land after continuous optimization. </center>
