In each diffusion step, a belief value between 0 and 1 is calculated for every variable. A value closer to 1 indicates a stronger inclination toward being true, and vice versa. We set a threshold to select variables with high belief and assign them accordingly to obtain a partial assignment. This partial assignment is then used to perform unit propagation for clause simplification. The unit propagation algorithm works as follows:  

If a clause contains a literal that is already satisfied by the current assignment, the clause is marked as satisfied. If all literals in a clause have been assigned but none satisfy it, a conflict signal is returned. For clauses that are not fully assigned, the unassigned literals are retained to form a simplified clause set. For unit clauses obtained during the simplification process (i.e., clauses containing only a single literal), the corresponding unassigned variable is directly assigned the appropriate value, further advancing the local solving process.
