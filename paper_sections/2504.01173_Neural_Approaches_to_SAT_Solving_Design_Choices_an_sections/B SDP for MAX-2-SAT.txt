Semidefinite programming (SDP) is a mathematical optimization technique primarily used for problems involving positive semidefinite matrices. In SDP, a linear objective function is optimized over a feasible region given by a spectrahedron (an intersection of a convex cone formed by positive semidefinite matrices and an affine subspace) Ramana and Goldman [1995]. Along with the broad scope of applications, SDP has been used to design approximation algorithms for discrete NP- hard problems Gartner and Matousek [2012]. This is achieved by lifting variables of a problem to a vector space and optimizing a loss function expressed in terms of these vectors.  

In this section, we provide a detailed derivation of the SDP relaxation for MAX- 2- SAT. The goal is to write an objective function for 2- CNF formulae, which consist of clauses \(c_{1},\ldots ,c_{k}\) over variables \(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}\) with at most two literals per clause.
