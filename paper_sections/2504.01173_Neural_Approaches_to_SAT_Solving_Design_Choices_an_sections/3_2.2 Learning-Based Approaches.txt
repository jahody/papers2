Machine learning (ML) is also being heavily utilized for SAT solving. Many approaches have been developed to guide traditional solvers Selsam and Bjørner [2019], Yolcu and Póczos [2019] or to solve SAT problems directly Selsam et al. [2018], Li and Si [2022]. To guide a solver, a neural network can be used to replace heuristics such as variable selection or restart policies. Importantly, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can also be trained to solve SAT problems end- to- end without relying on traditional algorithmic solvers Amizadeh et al. [2018]. These GNN- based approaches can operate directly on the graph representation of Boolean formulas, with variables and clauses forming nodes in a bipartite graph, and learn to predict satisfiability or produce satisfying assignments Li et al. [2023]. In this work, we focus on variants of GNNs that are recurrent and this allows us to scale the computation during inference or adapt the number of iterations for each instance separately.  

In Section 6 we will show an evidence that one can view the end- to- end ML approaches as bi- level optimization methods because during inference, the GNN behaves as a continuous solver trying to maximize the number of satisfied clauses. Therefore, during training, the outer loop of the bi- level optimization optimizes the weights of the network which then runs an inner loop that optimizes the values of variables to maximize the number of satisfiable clauses.
