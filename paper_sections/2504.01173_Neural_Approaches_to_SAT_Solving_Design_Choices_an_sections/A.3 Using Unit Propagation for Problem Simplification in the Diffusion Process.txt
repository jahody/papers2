In the diffusion process, each iteration provides a belief for every variable, which can be leveraged to continuously simplify the problem via a unit propagation algorithm until it converges to an empty problem, thereby obtaining a solution. The overall solving process is recursive, and its main steps are described as follows:
Table 8: Experimental results demonstrating the impact of hidden dimension size (d_model) on model performance and training duration. ‘Embedding Size (d_model)’ refers to the dimensionality of the hidden representations within the GNN. ‘Accuracy’ indicates the performance metric achieved by the model. ‘Time (hours)’ specifies the total time required to train the model for each corresponding dimension size.
