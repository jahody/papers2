The SDP solver optimizes the numbers in the matrix \(Y\) , but using the factorization, we can visualize what happens with the vectors \(\mathbf{y}_{1}\) . The process starts with random unit vectors that are continuously updated to maximize the objective function. If we fix the position of the vector \(\mathbf{y}_{0}\) (corresponding to the value true), we would see that the vectors of variables that will be set to true in the final assignment get closer to the vector \(\mathbf{y}_{0}\) , while the vectors \(\mathbf{y}_{j}\) of variables that will be set to false move away from it so that the inner product \(\langle \mathbf{y}_{0},\mathbf{y}_{j}\rangle\) is close to \(- 1\) .  

If the formula is satisfiable, the objective function drives the vectors to form two wellseparated clusters. However, if only a few clauses can be satisfied simultaneously, the vectors would end up being scattered.  

A simple way to round the resulting vectors \((\mathbf{y}_{1},\ldots ,\mathbf{y}_{n})\) and get the assignment for the original Boolean variables is to compute the inner product \(\langle \mathbf{y}_{0},\mathbf{y}_{i}\rangle\) and assign the value according
to its sign. It is also possible to assign the values by picking a random separating hyperplane, and it can be shown that this rounding gives a 0.8785- approximation of the integer program optimum Goemans and Williamson [1995].  

Note that the expressions of the clauses reach their maximum at 1 (when a clause is satisfied by the assignment). This means that the whole formula is satisfiable if the objective function achieves a value equal to the number of clauses in the formula. Another way to check satisfiability is to plug the obtained solution into the formula and verify whether it is satisfied. Therefore, we can obtain an incomplete SAT solver from this SDP formulation.  

Similar SDPs can be obtained for different versions of MAX- SAT (with larger clauses). From empirical observation, the convergence threshold of the SDP solver needs to be decreased significantly compared to MAX- 2- SAT in order to obtain a good approximation for these more complicated versions.
