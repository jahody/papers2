We utilize two complementary benchmark generators for evaluating the tested variants: the SR generator and a 3- SAT generator with the ratio between variable and clauses set close to the phase transition point.  

SR Generator The SR generator by Selsam et al. [Selsam et al., 2018] produces pairs of satisfiable and unsatisfiable formulas that differ by negating only a single literal. This design specifically prevents models from exploiting superficial features for classification. Intuitively, it works by iteratively sampling random clauses and adding them to a formula. After each addition, a SAT solver checks if the formula remains satisfiable. When adding a clause that finally makes the formula unsatisfiable, the generator saves this instance and creates its satisfiable counterpart by flipping a single literal in the last clause. To create each clause, it samples a small integer \(k\) based on a mix of Bernoulli and geometric distributions, then randomly selects \(k\) variables without replacement, negating each with 0.5 probability. This solver- driven approach ensures
that satisfiability classification requires understanding the logical structure rather than statistical properties. As reported in the review by Li et al. Li et al. [2023], the models trained on problems from this generator transfer the best to other problem distributions.  

3- SAT Generator We also employ a 3- SAT generator configured at the critical clause- to- variable ratio of 4.26, known as the phase transition point where SAT problems are empirically the most challenging to solve [Crawford and Auton, 1996]. At this ratio, approximately half of the generated instances are satisfiable. Each clause contains exactly 3 literals selected uniformly from the available variables, with each literal negated with 0.5 probability. Unlike the SR generator, 3- SAT focuses on generating naturally difficult problems rather than explicitly preventing superficial feature learning.
