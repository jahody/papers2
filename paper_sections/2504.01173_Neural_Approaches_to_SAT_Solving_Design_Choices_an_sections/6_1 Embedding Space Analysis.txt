Our analysis of variable embeddings reveals patterns that explain how GNNs learn to solve SAT problems. When visualizing these embeddings using dimensionality reduction McInnes et al. [2018], we observe that they form distinct clusters corresponding to optimal variable assignments.  

As shown in Figure 5, variable embeddings start randomly distributed but gradually organize into two clusters through message passing iterations. By applying k- means clustering ( \(k = 2\) ) to these embeddings, we can recover variable assignments that approximate optimal solutions, even from networks trained only to predict satisfiability status.
