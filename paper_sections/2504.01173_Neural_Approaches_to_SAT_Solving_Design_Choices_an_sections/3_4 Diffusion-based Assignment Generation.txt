In Section 5.4 will show how the GNNs we use can be extended to diffusion models which have in recent years emerged as a powerful approach for generative modeling across domains Ho et al. [2020]. These models learn to transform a random noise distributions (such as multi- variate Gaussian distribution) to complex distributions behind the given domain (i.e., distribution of images of human faces). For practical applications, diffusion models are typically conditioned on an input so that the generated sample has specific characteristics. In our case, we will condition the model by the bipartite graph of the CNF formula.
