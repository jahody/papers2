A specific type incomplete solvers that have been explored in recent research Kyrillidis et al. [2020], Hosny and Reda [2024] are explored continuous relaxations of MaxSAT, that transform the discrete problem into a continuous optimization task. These methods map Boolean variables to continuous domains, enabling the application of gradient- based optimization techniques. The Fourier- SAT method Kyrillidis et al. [2020], for instance, transforms Boolean formulas into multilinear polynomials through Walsh- Fourier transform and then optimize the continuous variables w.r.t. the resulting polynomial.  

Continuous relaxations can also be obtained by making the objective function convex as often done when designing approximation algorithms which provide guarantees for their performance.
The guarantees can be improved by lifting the variables into a high- dimensional vector space and optimizing vectors instead of scalar values. The optimized vectors are finally rounded to discrete values.  

Semidefinite Programming (SDP) relaxation, particularly for MAX- 2- SAT or MAX- 3- SAT, illustrates this approach elegantly. In SDP relaxation, Boolean variables \(x_{i} \in \{0,1\}\) are transformed into unit vectors \(\mathbf{y}_{i}\) in a high- dimensional space. An additional vector \(\mathbf{y}_{0}\) is introduced to represent the value "true." The Boolean variable \(x_{i}\) is considered true if \(\mathbf{y}_{i}\) is close to \(\mathbf{y}_{0}\) (positive inner product) and false if it is far from \(\mathbf{y}_{0}\) (negative inner product).  

The optimization process for these vectors follows a pattern:  

1. Initialize random unit vectors for each variable  

2. Optimize these vectors to maximize the number of satisfied clauses, expressed as a function of inner products between vectors  

3. Round the resulting vectors to discrete assignments (typically based on the sign of inner products with \(\mathbf{y}_{0}\) )  

This relaxation enables the application of powerful continuous optimization techniques while providing approximation guarantees. For MAX- 2- SAT, this approach yields an approximation ratio of 0.878, meaning the solution will satisfy at least 87.8% of the maximum possible number of clauses.
