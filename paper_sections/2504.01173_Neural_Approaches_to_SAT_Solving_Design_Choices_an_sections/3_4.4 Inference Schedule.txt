During inference, we can accelerate the generation process by using fewer denoising steps than were used during training or use more denoising steps with the hope to increase the quality of outputs. The tuple of time steps used for inference \((T,T - 1,\ldots ,t_{0})\) is called a schedule. The function approximator in the diffusion model is normally conditioned by the sample at a given time step and also the time step itself \((f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_{t},t))\) but as we show in Section 5.4.1, the time step conditioning is not needed. This means that in our case the schedule is defined only by the number of time steps used.
