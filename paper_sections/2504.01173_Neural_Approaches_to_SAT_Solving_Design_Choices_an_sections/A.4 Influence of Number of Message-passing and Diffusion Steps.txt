For completeness, we also report evaluations in which the number of diffusion steps is fixed and the number of message- passing steps is changing (Table 10) and vice versa (Table 9). We observe that the expansion of the number of iterative steps does not always bring benefits: when the number of one kind of step is fixed, further increasing the number of another kind of step beyond a certain threshold will not lead to performance improvement.
