Boolean satisfiability (SAT) is a fundamental problem in computer science that asks whether a given Boolean formula has a satisfying assignment. The formula is built from propositional variables \(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots\) that can take values from \(\{0,1\}\) , representing false and true respectively, and logical connectives: conjunction \((\wedge)\) , disjunction \((\vee)\) , and negation \((\neg)\) . While other connectives like implication \((\rightarrow)\) and equivalence \((\leftrightarrow)\) exist, they can be expressed using these basic operators.  

A literal is either a propositional variable \(x\) or its negation \(\neg x\) . While Boolean formulas can take arbitrary form, the most common representation is the conjunctive normal form (CNF), where a formula is a conjunction of clauses, and each clause is a disjunction of literals. For example, \((x_{1}\vee \neg x_{2})\wedge (x_{2}\vee x_{3})\) is a CNF formula with two clauses. We note that any Boolean formula can be transformed into an equisatisfiable CNF formula, albeit potentially requiring additional variables.  

An assignment \(\sigma\) maps each propositional variable to either 0 or 1. We say \(\sigma\) satisfies a CNF formula if at least one literal in each clause evaluates to true under \(\sigma\) . For instance, the assignment \(\sigma (x_{1}) = 1,\sigma (x_{2}) = 0,\sigma (x_{3}) = 1\) satisfies the formula \((x_{1}\vee \neg x_{2})\wedge (x_{2}\vee x_{3})\) as both clauses contain a true literal.  

SAT is a special case of the more general Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) framework Brailsford et al. [1999]. A CSP consists of a set of variables, each with a domain of possible values, and a set of constraints that specify allowed combinations of values for groups of variables. While SAT variables are restricted to Boolean values and constraints take the form of clauses, CSPs can accommodate richer variable domains and constraint types.
