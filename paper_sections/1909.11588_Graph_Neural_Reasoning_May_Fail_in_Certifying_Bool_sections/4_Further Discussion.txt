In this manuscript, we provide some discussions about the GNNs that consider the SAT and 2QBF problem as static graph, we haven't considered the shrinkage condition, which may apply dynamic GNN as [9], dues to the difficulty about proving the dynamic graph as we need to prove all the dynamic updating methods are impossible or not. Ought to be regarded that, this manuscript does not claim GNN is provably unable to achieve UNSAT, which remains an open issue.
Belief propagation (BP) is a Bayesian message- passing method first proposed by [10], which is a useful approximation algorithm and has been applied to the SAT problems (specifically in 3- SAT [8]) and 2QBF problems [19]. BP can find the witnesses of unsatisfiability of 2QBF by adopting a bias estimation strategy. Each round of BP allows the user to select the most biased \(\forall\) - variable and assign the biased value to the variable. After all the \(\forall\) - variables are assigned, the formula is simplified by the assignment and sent to SAT solvers. The procedure returns the assignment as a witness of unsatisfiability if the simplified formula is unsatisfiable, or UNKNOWN otherwise. However, the fact that BP is used for each \(\forall\) - variable assignment leads to high overhead, similar to the RL approach given by [5]. It is interesting, however, to see that with the added overhead, BP can find witnesses of unsatisfiability, which is what one- shot GNN- based embeddings cannot achieve.  

This manuscript revealed the previously unrecognized limitation of GNN in reasoning about unsatisfiability of SAT problems. This limitation is probably rooted in the simplicity of message- passing scheme, which is good enough for embedding graph features, but not for conducting complex reasoning on top of the graph structures.
