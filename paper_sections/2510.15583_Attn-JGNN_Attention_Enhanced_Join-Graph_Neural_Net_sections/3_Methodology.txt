In this section, we first elaborate on the framework of our model (Attn- JGNN) and its operating principles, followed by an introduction to the integration of tree decomposition and attention mechanisms. As a neural- network- based implementation of the Iterative Join- Graph Propagation (IJGP) algorithm, this framework features a unique tree decomposition structure that facilitates better integration with the attention mechanism. By formulating #SAT as a probabilistic inference task, we demonstrate how Attn- JGNN solves the problem (see Fig. 1).  

<center>Fig.1: For the #SAT problem, our model uses two Graph Attention Network (GAT) layers for message passing and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layer to estimate the partition function, serving as an approximate solver. A pooling layer compresses the processed variable and clause node features into a global representation, which is fed into the MLP layer. </center>
