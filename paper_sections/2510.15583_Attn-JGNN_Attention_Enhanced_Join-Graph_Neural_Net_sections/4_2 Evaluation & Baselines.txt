Following BPNN and NSNet, we use the (1) root mean square error (RMSE) between the estimated log countings and ground truth as our evaluation metrics. We compare Attn- JGNN, the neural baseline BPNN and NSNet, and two state- of- the- art approximate model counting solvers, ApproxMC3 and F2 [1]. For ApproxMC3 and F2, we set a time limit of 5,000 seconds on each instance.
