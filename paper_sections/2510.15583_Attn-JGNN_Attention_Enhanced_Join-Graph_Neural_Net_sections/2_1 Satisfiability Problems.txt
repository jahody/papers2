In propositional logic, a Boolean formula is composed of Boolean variables and logical operators (e.g., negation \((\neg)\) , conjunction \((\wedge)\) , and disjunction \((\vee)\) ). It is standard practice to represent Boolean formulas in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), which takes the form of a conjunction of clauses—where each clause is a disjunction of literals (a literal is either a variable or its negation). Given a CNF formula, the SAT (Satisfiability Problem) asks whether there exists any variable assignment that satisfies the formula. In contrast, the goal of #SAT (Propositional Model Counting Problem) is to count the total number of such satisfying assignments (also called "models").
