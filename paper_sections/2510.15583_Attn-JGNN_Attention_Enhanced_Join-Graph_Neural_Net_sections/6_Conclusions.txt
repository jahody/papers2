In this work, we propose a neural framework for solving the satisfiability problem. Our framework combines tree decomposition and GAT, includes IJGP in the latent space, and performs partition function estimation to solve #SAT. Experimental evaluation on synthetic datasets and existing benchmarks shows that our approach significantly outperforms NSNet and other neural baselines and achieves competitive results compared to state- of- the- art solvers.
