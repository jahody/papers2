In this subsection, we verify the knowledge transfer ability of our model. we fixed the target domain as the MIS problem and used Max- SAT, Max- Cut, and MDS as source domains to check different degrees of transferability. To be concrete, we fed the data from different source domains into our framework for pre- training and domain adaptation and observed how the performance was affected by the selection of domains. We selected two scales of nodes, i.e., 450 variables and 760 variables, for demonstration. The results were shown in Figure 4 where darker colors indicated better performance and transferability.

From the heat maps, we can observe that Max- SAT \(\rightarrow\) MIS always obtained the best results compared with the other two types of knowledge transfer, which showed that Max- SAT was more general and had the strongest transferability across different CO problems. Moreover, MDS is a more relevant CO problem to MIS compared with Max- Cut. Therefore, we observed better results from MDS \(\rightarrow\) MIS than Max- Cut \(\rightarrow\) MIS. This observation answered Q3 where different source domains do affect the performance of the target domain. From a practical viewpoint, selecting an appropriate source domain was always hard, and irrelevant tasks would generate negative transfers and eventually affect the performance of the target domain.
