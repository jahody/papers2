In this section, we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed framework and aimed to answer Q1. Without loss of generality, Max- Cut, MIS, and MDS are selected for evaluation. Our framework is also adaptive to other COs that can be transformed as Max- SAT.  

For Max- Cut, we first reported the mean \(p\) - values across 1,000 regular graphs with 100, 200, 500, and 1000 nodes for three levels of node degrees in Table 1. Then, the experiments on the GSET benchmark were carried out and the number of cuts was reported in Table 2 for comparison. When encountering large- scale datasets (G22 and G55), traditional methods, e.g., EO and BLS, were out of memory and could not obtain the results. Based on the two tables, we have the following observations: (1) Our method obtained the best results compared with learning- based methods, which demonstrated that the proposed framework exhibited the powerful ability to learn useful information from CO problems. The results also showed that Max- SAT can boost the performance of solving COs; (2) Our method was superior in most cases compared with all baselines. The advantages of our method were mainly in large- scale Max- Cut problems (e.g., \(n = 800\) , G22, and G55) where the performance surpassed traditional methods;

(3) Traditional or heuristic methods are very competitive in Max-Cut. However, the gaps between our method and these methods were small. Besides, the time of training and inference for our method was much less than these methods.  

For MIS and MDS, we reported the number of sets for MIS and the number of dominated nodes for MDS in Tables 3 and 4. \(V\) and \(E\) are the sets for nodes and edges. Greedy denotes the classical greedy algorithm. Larger and smaller values denote better results for MIS and MDS, respectively. The experiments were carried out on four frb datasets. Similar results can be observed in these two CO problems. Particularly, In MIS, our results were relatively closer to the results obtained by the solver, which showed the effectiveness of our framework.  

Based on the results obtained on the above three CO problems, we can answer Q1: Max- SAT offered common knowledge and the pre- training and adaptation pipeline built based on Max- SAT can learn transferable and generalizable features to improve the ability to solve different CO problems on graphs.
