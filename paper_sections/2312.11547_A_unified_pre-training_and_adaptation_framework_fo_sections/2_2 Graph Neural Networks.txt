GNNs belong to a typical deep- learning framework for graphs that follow a message- passing mechanism [8]. Graph convolution networks (GCNs) [10] define graph convolutions on the spectral domain so that the structural information from neighbors can be aggregated. GraphSAGE [32] proposes an inductive representation learning method based on aggregation and sampling directly on the spatial domain. Graph attention networks (GATs) [33] utilize self- attention mechanisms to learn node features where the importance of neighbors can be considered during the aggregation of information. More recently, prompt tuning has been used to generalize GNNs [34,35]. GPPT [34] proposes a graph prompting function for GNNs so that the pre- trained models can predict labels without fine- tuning. Since GNNs have been successfully used in various downstream tasks, researchers pay attention to the theories behind GNNs. For example, over- smoothing [36] and over- squashing [37] are the two main issues for GNNs. BORF [38] proposes a rewiring algorithm based on Ollivier- Ricci curvature to relieve both over- smoothing and over- squashing problems for GNNs. The expressive abilities of GNNs have also been studied to demonstrate why GNNs perform well in many tasks [9,39,40].  

Recently, GNNs have been used in graph domain adaptation to address the domain shift on graphs [41]. Domain adaptation on graphs aims at leveraging knowledge learned from the source domain to improve the performance of a GNN model on a different target domain. Adversarial training is often used to build the alignment framework [42,43]. For example, TFLG [43] utilizes instance and class levels of structures and leverages adversarial training to learn domain- invariant features. Except for the features that can be easily used for domain alignment, many researchers seek to learn invariant information from different levels. GCAN [44] is a graph convolutional adversarial network introduced for unsupervised domain adaptation by jointly modeling structures, domain labels, and class labels. StruRW [45] presents a structural re- weighting method to address the conditional structure shift problem. Since spectral properties play an important role in graph structures, many works also attempt to explore the alignment of spectral information [46,47].
