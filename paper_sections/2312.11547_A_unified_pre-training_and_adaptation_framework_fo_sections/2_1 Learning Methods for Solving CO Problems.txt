Traditional methods for solving CO mainly include branch and bound, dynamic programming, and heuristic algorithms. Branch and bound is a branch- and- prune search method used to reduce the search space [6, 16, 17]. It progressively decomposes the problem into smaller subproblems and applies pruning strategies to exclude branches that cannot produce the optimal solution. Dynamic programming breaks down a large problem into smaller subproblems and solves them by utilizing the relationships between the subproblems [18- 21]. Dynamic programming is suitable for problems with overlapping subproblem structures, such as the knapsack problem [22] and TSP [23]. Heuristic methods employ heuristic strategies or random operations to search the solution space and continuously improve the current solution until a satisfactory solution is found or a predetermined stopping condition is met. Common heuristic algorithms include greedy algorithms [24], local search [25], simulated annealing [26], and genetic algorithms [27]. Traditional methods for solving CO problems have limitations including high computational complexity, lack of scalability for large- size problems, and limited solution quality in terms of finding globally optimal solutions.  

In recent years, deep learning methods have emerged as promising approaches to tackle these problems by leveraging the power of data- driven modeling and computational intelligence. One category of methods approximates the process of solving CO problems through deep learning methods [28]. By learning from a dataset of problem instances, these deep learning models can capture intrinsic patterns and dependencies in the problem and the predictions are then utilized to guide the search process toward better solutions. These approaches offer advantages in terms of speed and scalability as they reduce the requirements of expensive evaluations for the objective function during the search. Another category of methods is based on learning- based heuristics and meta- heuristics [12- 14, 29]. Deep learning models can be employed to create intelligent decision rules or policies to guide the search process. Reinforcement learning techniques have demonstrated success in learning effective exploration- exploitation strategies for
CO problems [30,31]. By incorporating learning- based heuristics into traditional optimization algorithms, better- quality solutions can be obtained with reduced computational effort.
