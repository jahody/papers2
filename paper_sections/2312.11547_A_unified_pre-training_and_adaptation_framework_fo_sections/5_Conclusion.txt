In this study, we aimed to discover the transferability of deep learning architectures for solving different CO problems on graphs. To achieve this goal, we leveraged the Max- SAT problem as a general formulation of original CO problems. The key advantages were two- fold. First, Max- SAT served as a bridge for various CO problems and provided a tool for discovering common properties in CO problems. Second, Max- SAT problems were represented as clauses that included logical information in addition to the simple correlations in graphs. By further constructing a pre- training and adaptation framework, we can extract transferable features that can be used for various CO problems. Experiments showed that incorporating Max- SAT indeed improved the ability to solve various CO problems on graphs.  

Our current work can be extended from the following directions. The pre- training stage is built on supervised tasks where labeled data samples are required. As a future direction, it is necessary to develop unsupervised pre- training paradigms that can fully leverage information from the data itself. Moreover, advanced GNNs that are more suitable for the properties of CO problems should be designed in the future.
