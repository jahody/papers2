Given a graph from any CO, we use clauses with variables to describe the objective function and the constraint conditions. Max- SAT is an optimization problem that contains a set of clauses and variables. Define \(m\) clauses \(\mathcal{C} = \{c_{1},c_{2},\dots ,c_{m}\}\) and \(n\) variables \(\mathcal{X} = \{x_{1},x_{2},\dots ,x_{n}\}\) , the Max- SAT problem is to find a truth assignment of variables so that the number of satisfied clauses is maximized.  

To generate clauses, we define two rules for the objective function and constraint conditions respectively. The soft rule is based on the objective function and the hard rule is based on the constraint conditions. The difference between those two rules mainly lies in whether the clauses should be strictly satisfied. For clarification, we let the variable \(x_{i}\) correspond to the node \(v_{i}\) in graph \(\mathcal{G}\) . For demonstration purposes, we provide the details of transformations for Max- Cut, MIS, and MDS problems.  

For every \(v_{i} \in \mathcal{V}\) in MIS problems, the clauses are generated by:  

\[\begin{array}{l}{c_{h} = \neg x_{i}\vee \neg x_{j}|e_{i,j}\in \mathcal{E},}\\ {c_{s} = x_{i}|v_{i}\in \mathcal{V},} \end{array} \quad (3.5a)\]  

where \(c_{h} \in \mathcal{C}_{h}\) denotes the hard clause which describes that the set cannot contain the node and its neighbors at the same time, \(c_{s} \in \mathcal{C}_{s}\) denotes the soft clause which describes that the number of nodes in the MIS problem should be maximized, \(\neg\) and \(\vee\) are the negation and disjunction.  

For every \(v_{i} \in \mathcal{V}\) in MDS problems, the clauses are generated by:  

\[\begin{array}{l}{c_{h} = x_{i}\vee x_{j}|e_{i,j}\in \mathcal{E},}\\ {c_{s} = \neg x_{i}|v_{i}\in \mathcal{V},} \end{array} \quad (3.6a)\]  

where \(c_{h} \in \mathcal{C}_{h}\) describes that the node or at least one of its neighbor nodes belongs to MDS, and \(c_{s} \in \mathcal{C}_{s}\) describes that the number of nodes in MDS should be minimized.
For every \(e_{i,j} \in \mathcal{E}\) in Max- Cut problems, the clauses are generated by:  

\[\begin{array}{l}{c_{s} = x_{i}\vee x_{j},}\\ {c_{s}^{\prime} = \neg x_{i}\vee \neg x_{j},} \end{array} \quad (3.7a)\]  

where \(c_{s}\) and \(c_{s}^{\prime}\) are all soft clauses belonging to \(\mathcal{C}_{s}\) that describe the number of cut edges that should be maximized.
