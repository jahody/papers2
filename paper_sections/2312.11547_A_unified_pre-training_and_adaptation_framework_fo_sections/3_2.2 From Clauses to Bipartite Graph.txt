The soft and hard clauses describe the relations between clauses and variables, which reveals the logical dependencies. Then, we can use bipartite graphs to further represent these relations in Max- SAT. In general, the bipartite graph is denoted as \(\tilde{\mathcal{G}} = (\tilde{\mathcal{V}}_{x},\tilde{\mathcal{V}}_{c},\tilde{\mathcal{E}})\) where \(\tilde{\mathcal{V}}_{x}\) and \(\tilde{\mathcal{V}}_{c}\) are node sets, and \(\tilde{\mathcal{E}}\) is the edge set. The main difference between graphs and bipartite graphs is that the nodes in bipartite graphs belong to two different types. The variables \(\mathcal{X}\) correspond to the set of nodes \(\tilde{\mathcal{V}}_{x}\) and the clauses \(\mathcal{C}\) correspond to the set of nodes \(\tilde{\mathcal{V}}_{c}\) . To generate the bipartite graph, the core step is to construct the edges between nodes. For each variable \(x_{i}\) in each clause \(c_{i}\) , an edge \(\tilde{e}_{i,j} \in \tilde{\mathcal{E}}\) corresponds to the affiliation between the variable and the clause.  

In this transfer process, we transfer the origin graph \(\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})\) of the CO problem into the bipartite graph \(\tilde{\mathcal{G}} = (\tilde{\mathcal{V}}_{x},\tilde{\mathcal{V}}_{c},\tilde{\mathcal{E}})\) . A concrete transfer process can be shown in Figure 1. We choose Max- Cut as an example for demonstration. The first step is to transfer the graph in Max- Cut into a set of clauses in Max- SAT. We use the hard and soft rules to generate these clauses. After generating these clauses, we then transfer them into a bipartite graph. The variables and clauses are set as nodes and the affiliations between variables and clauses constitute edges. The new bipartite graph can be then used for the next feature extraction process.

Notice that transferring graphs in original COs to bipartite graphs has two main advantages: First, original graphs only contain simple dependencies between variables. In contrast, the bipartite graphs transferred from Max- SAT clauses are then equipped with logical information from COs; Second, the bipartite graphs are general forms that can represent various COs on graphs since all of these COs can be transformed into Max- SAT problems. Therefore, we can easily construct a knowledge transfer framework to leverage the generalizable and transferable information of these problems with the help of bipartite graphs.
