The last step of our model is to search the feasible solutions for CO problems with constraint conditions by using the predictions generated by our framework. We can also get close to optimal solutions with a search algorithm. For Max- Cut problems without hard clauses, our model can directly infer the truth assignment and obtain the target values. For problems with hard clauses, we introduce a heuristic local search method to discretely obtain feasible solutions that satisfy constraints and obtain the target values.  

Local search is a typical search method for discrete optimization. We adopt a 2- improvement local search algorithm [49,50] that iterates over all nodes in the graph and attempts to replace a 1- labeled node \(v_{i}\) with two 1- labeled nodes \(v_{j}\) and \(v_{k}\) . For the MIS problem, \(v_{j}\) and \(v_{k}\) must be the neighbors of \(v_{i}\) . These two nodes are 1- tight and are not connected. Here, a node is 1- tight if exactly one of its neighbors is 1- labeled. In other words, \(v_{i}\) is the only 1- labeled neighbor of \(v_{j}\) and \(v_{k}\) in the graph. Notice that this local search algorithm can find a valid 2- improvement in \(O(E)\) time if it exists. We introduce this method with fixed steps to find a feasible solution and evaluate the performance of our model.
