In our MAXCUT experiment, we only consider instances with positive edge weights. In this case, MAXCUT is identical to maximum 2- Colorability. Let \(G = (V,E)\) be an input graph. We can model the MAXCUT problem for \(G\) as a CSP instance by using the same reduction we use for vertex coloring in Section B.2 but with the number of colors fixed at \(k = 2\) .  

Data Our training distribution \(\Omega_{\mathrm{MCUT}}\) consists if Erdős- Rényi graphs with \(n = 100\) vertices and an edge probability sampled uniformly from \(p\in [0.05,0.3]\) . Our validation data uses the same distribution for \(p\) but with \(n = 500\) vertices.  

Baselines Our classical baselines are a constructive greedy algorithm and a well- known approximation algorithm based on SDP (Goemans and Williamson 1995). For both, we use the implementation of (Mehta 2019) and we run SDP with a 3- hour timeout. We were unable to obtain results for SDP for graphs with over 1000 vertices within this timeout.  

We consider three neural approaches as baselines: RUNCSP (Tönshoff et al. 2021), ECORD (Barrett et al. 2020) and ECO- DQN (Barrett, Parsonson, and Laterre 2022). RUNCSP is also trained on \(\Omega_{\mathrm{MCUT}}\) . We train ECO- DQN and ECORD on the same data distributions used by Barrett, Parsonson, and Laterre (2022) in their Gset experiments. More specifically, ECO- DQN and ECORD train on Erdős- Rényi graphs with 200 and 500 vertices, respectively. Both methods were validated with the "ER500" validation dataset from their own experiments, which contains Erdős- Rényi graphs with 500 vertices. Note that we select a single model for each method. Barrett, Parsonson, and Laterre (2022) suggest selecting different models with different validation datasets modeled after each group of graphs in the Gset test data. We do not adopt this procedure and select a single model using Erdős- Rényi graphs for validation. The goal of our setup is to test the generalization of one model to new sizes and structures not seen during training and validation.  

We also experimented with training and validating ECO- DQN and ECORD on our data distributions but found the data chosen by Barrett, Parsonson, and Laterre (2022) to be better for their methods. Table 7 provides extended results of the MAXCUT experiment across all used Gset graphs.
