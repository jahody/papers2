The MODEL RB defines an easy way to generate theoretically hard random CSP instances by randomly choosing a number of disallowed tuples of a fixed arity.  

A class of random CSP instances of model RB is denoted \(\mathrm{RB}(k,n,\alpha ,r,p)\) where each instance consists of \(n\geq 2\) variables with domain size \(d = n^{\alpha}\) for \(a > 0\) . Each instance has \(m = r n\ln n\) constraints for \(r > 0\) of arity \(k\geq 2\) , with each constraint disallowing \(t = p d^{k}\) randomly selected tuples. Note that the selection of scopes and tuples is performed with repetition. This is due to the fact that the number of repeated constraints and tuples are asymptotically smaller than the total number of constraints and tuples and thus can be neglected. The hardest of the MODEL RB instances occur around the critical value \(p_{cr} = 1 - e^{- \alpha /r}\) of \(p\) (Xu and Li 2003).  

Data Our training data consists of randomly generated MODEL RB instances with 30 variables and arity 2. We randomly select \(d\in (n^{1 / k},2n^{1 / k}]\) and \(m\in\) \([n\log_{k}d,2n\log_{k}d]\) and generate instances with \(p = 0,9p_{cr}\) slightly smaller than the critical values of \(p\) to increase the number of satisfiable instances seen during training. To generate one instance we build \(m\) constraints, each by randomly selecting scope of \(k\) distinct variables with repetition and then randomly selecting with repetition a relation of \(t\) distinct disallowed tuples. Our validation data contains 200 instances sampled from the exact same distribution.  

The test dataset is obtained from the XCSP project (Audemard et al. 2020) and contains 50 satisfiable MODEL RB instances with 50 variables, each with domain size 22 and about 500 constraints of arity 2. More specifically, we use all instances of the Random- RB- 2- 50- 23f dataset as our test data.  

Baselines We used three state- of- the- art CSP- solvers from the XCSP Competition as baselines: Picat (Zhou 2022), ACE (Lecoutre 2022), and CoSoCo (Audemard 2018). Picat is a SAT- based solver and the winner of the most recent XCSP Competition (Audemard et al. 2020). ACE and CoSoCo are based on constraint propagation. We include CoSoCo because it demonstrated very strong performance specifically on binary MODEL RB instances in previous CSP Competitions. Indeed, it also is the best performing baseline in our experiment.
