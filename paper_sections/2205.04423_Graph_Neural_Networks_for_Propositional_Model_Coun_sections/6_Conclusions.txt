We presented BPGAT, an extension of the BPNN architecture presented in [15], which combines the algorithmic structure of belief propagation and the learning paradigm of graph attention networks. We conducted several experiments to investigate the scalability and generalization abilities of our network, showing that it is able to achieve a performance comparable to (and in some settings higher than) state- of- the- art approximate #SAT solvers, albeit the lack of any theoretical guarantees on the quality of the solution. Finally, we highlighted the efficiency of our model, both in terms of required training data and in terms of running time.  

As future research directions, we will analyze the viability of extending our model to tackle weighted conjunctive normal form model counting (weighted #CNF) problems. In this scenario, a straightforward application of our model would be that of approximate probabilistic inference on Bayesian Networks, which in many cases (e.g. when solved using variational inference) comes without any statistical guarantees. It would be also interesting to generalize this approach to other counting problems, such as counting the number of independent sets of a given size in a graph, as part of a broader research program aiming at exploring the application of graph attention networks to logical reasoning tasks.
