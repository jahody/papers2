<center>Figure 5: Evolution of variable embeddings during message passing iterations for a satisfiable SR40 instance. The visualization shows 2D projections at different stages (Initial through Iteration 25), colored k-means algorithm in each iteration (green/red). Initially random, embeddings gradually organize into two distinct clusters often corresponding to optimal variable assignments. This clustering behavior was observed across different model architectures and training objectives—notably, even models trained solely for SAT/UNSAT classification (without explicit assignment supervision) develop this embedding separation. This phenomenon supports our interpretation that GNNs implicitly perform continuous optimization similar to SDP relaxation for SAT problems. </center>
