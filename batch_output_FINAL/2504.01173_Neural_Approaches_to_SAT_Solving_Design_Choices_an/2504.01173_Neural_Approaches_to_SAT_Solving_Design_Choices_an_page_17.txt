Table 4: Performance of a model trained on SR40 (VCG+RNN with closest assignment supervision) when tested across various benchmarks with a maximum of 100 message-passing iterations and early stopping. The model maintains reasonable performance on SR100 ( \(74.2\%\) decision accuracy) but degrades on larger instances. "UNSAT Instances (gap \(= =1\) )" shows the percentage of UNSAT instances where the model achieved a gap of 1, which is always optimal for SR datasets but not always achievable for 3SAT instances. "Steps" columns indicate average/median iterations required to reach solutions, demonstrating the model's efficiency.

Table 5: Performance of a model trained on SR100 (VCG+RNN with closest assignment supervision) when tested on SR benchmarks with a maximum of 100 message-passing iterations and early stopping. Given that the SR40-trained model achieved only \(3\%\) SAT accuracy on SR400 (see Table 4), we focused on evaluating how training on larger instances improves scaling. The results show dramatic improvement on larger benchmarks ( \(36.5\%\) vs \(3\%\) on SR400), demonstrating that training on larger problems significantly enhances generalization capacity. The "Steps" metrics confirm the SR100-trained model requires fewer iterations on larger problems (e.g., 30.68 vs 41.33 average iterations for SAT instances on SR400).
