simple example is the formula (or the circuit) that encodes " \(a\oplus b\) ", where \(a\) and \(b\) are two Boolean variables and " \(\oplus\) " is the XOR operation. Due to the commutativity of XOR, " \(b\oplus a\) " is equivalent to " \(a\oplus b\) ". However, a satisfying assignment requires \(a\) and \(b\) to take different values because only " \(0\oplus 1\) " or " \(1\oplus 0\) " results in 1. Existing methods predict Boolean assignments for \(a\) and \(b\) concurrently. The concurrent prediction on each variable solely depends on the graph embedding of the variable node. Meanwhile, \(a\) and \(b\) share the same embedding because they are symmetric in CNF or circuit form. Therefore, the predictions for \(a\) and \(b\) inevitably become the same, which is clearly not a satisfying variable assignment for the formula.  

We attribute this problem to the concurrent prediction in existing model that does not factor in variable dependency in SAT problems. Variable dependency refers to the fact that the prediction of one variable assignment will affect other variables. In the " \(a\oplus b\) " example, if \(a\) is assigned to be 0, then \(b\) must be 1, despite that \(a\) and \(b\) are symmetric. To address this problem, we introduce a recurrent neural network (RNN) in the SAT assignment decoding layer. With the help of RNN, later predictions will be able to "remember" prior variable assignments. We call our new model AsymSAT, because it can produce asymmetric SAT solutions given symmetric SAT problems. We show by experiments that this small change can significantly improve GNN- based SAT solving.  

Overall, our main contributions in this paper are:  

- We identify the need of addressing variable dependency in the existing GNN-based end-to-end SAT solving methods.- We propose an improvement to the neural network architecture to take dependency among variables into consideration. Our AsymSAT model uses RNN to make sequential predictions of SAT solutions.- We demonstrate that with this small change, AsymSAT achieves a higher accuracy in SAT and Circuit-SAT solving compared to prior works. In addition to the end-to-end machine-learning-based SAT solving, the idea of sequential predictions proposed in this paper could potentially also benefit hybrid SAT solvers that take machine-learning as one searching heuristic.  

The paper is organized as follows: the next section provides a background on SAT problems and the existing GNN- based end- to- end SAT solving methods. Section 3 highlights the variable dependency in SAT solving. Section 4 introduces our improvement to the GNN architecture for SAT solving, followed by experiments in Section 5 and the related works in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.  

## 2 Background  

### 2.1 Boolean Satisfiability Problem  

The Boolean satisfiability problem talks about propositional logic with Boolean variables and Boolean operators like "and" \((\wedge)\) , "or" \((\vee)\) , "not" \((\neg)\) . The problem is to decide whether there exist assignments to the Boolean variables so that a given propositional logic formula evaluates to true under such assignment. The expected answer is either satisfi  

able (SAT) or unsatisfiable (UNSAT). In case the formula is satisfiable, we also expect to know the satisfying variable assignment.  

In Boolean satisfiability problem, the input is usually a Boolean formula in the conjunctive norm form (CNF). In CNF, the variables and their negations are called the literals, which are first connected with disjunctions \((\vee)\) to form the clauses. The clauses are then connected with conjunctions \((\wedge)\) . An arbitrary Boolean formula can always be converted into CNF using Boolean algebra, though the number of clauses may exponentially blow up. Alternatively, Tseitin transformation [Tseitin, 1983] converts a formula into an equi- satisfiable CNF, whose size is linear to the number of operators in the original one. Therefore, it is the preferred solution of CNF conversion in modern SAT solving.  

Besides CNF, the input of SAT could also be a circuit, which is essentially a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with each node representing either a circuit input, a logic gate or the circuit output. The goal is to find an input combination that causes the circuit output to become 1. The circuit form is more natural in some applications (for example, EDA). Note that the circuit form can be converted into a CNF formula by introducing new variables, and the number of clauses and variables in the converted CNF is proportional to the number of graph nodes in the circuit DAG [Prestwich, 2009]. On the other hand, a CNF formula can also be converted back into a circuit form, as presented in [Amizadeh et al., 2018, Appendix C].  

### 2.2 Solving SAT Problems by Graph Neural Networks  

Selsam et al. proposed using a graph neural network to decide whether a Boolean formula in CNF is satisfiable or not [Selsam et al., 2018]. This is an end- to- end method, where the problem input is a bipartite graph with nodes representing either a literal or a clause in CNF. The only output of the neural network is a single bit representing the satisfiability of the formula. An edge between a literal node and a clause node in the bipartite graph indicates that the literal is contained in the clause. Each node has an initial embedding, which is updated by iterations of message- passing between literals and clauses. Finally, the literal embeddings are sent to a multi- layer perceptron (MLP) to generate a vote. The averaged vote from all literals is used to decide satisfiability. The paper also demonstrated it is possible to decode satisfying assignments from the literal embeddings via k- means clustering.  

### 2.3 Solving Circuit-SAT Problems by Graph Neural Networks  

When the problem is formulated in the circuit form, we automatically have a graph structure. Graph neural network can be similarly applied in Circuit- SAT problems. Note that any logic function can be implemented with only AND gates and NOT gates. A circuit graph made up of only these two types of gates forms an And- Inverter- Graph (AIG), which is commonly used in the EDA community. Amizadeh et al. developed a GNN- based model, named DG- DAGRNN to solve Circuit- SAT problems by machine learning [Amizadeh et al., 2018]. The types of graph nodes (whether a node is a logic
