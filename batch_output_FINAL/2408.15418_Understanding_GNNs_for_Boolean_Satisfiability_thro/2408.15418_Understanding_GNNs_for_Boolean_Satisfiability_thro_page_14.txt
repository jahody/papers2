<center>Figure 8: Histograms of relative gaps between the final SDP objective value obtained from NeuroSAT embeddings and the same objective value obtained with an SDP solver. The plot on the left depicts the results for the matrix \(Y^{(t)}\) with \(t = 40\) . The plot on the right depicts results for the case where this matrix is further optimized by an SDP solver. A negative gap means that the subsequent optimization found a solution with better objective value than the SDP solver, which was initialized randomly. </center>  

<center>Figure 9: A heat map (for a single MAX-2-SAT instance) showing the change of values in the symmetric matrix \(Y^{(t)}\) after further optimization. The largest change happens in the first row and in the first column, which correspond to inner products of each literal embedding with the vector \(y_0\) (corresponding to the value TRUE). </center>
