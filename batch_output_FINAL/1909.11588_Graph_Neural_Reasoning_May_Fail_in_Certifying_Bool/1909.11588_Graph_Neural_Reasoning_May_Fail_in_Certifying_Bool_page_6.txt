Belief propagation (BP) is a Bayesian message- passing method first proposed by [10], which is a useful approximation algorithm and has been applied to the SAT problems (specifically in 3- SAT [8]) and 2QBF problems [19]. BP can find the witnesses of unsatisfiability of 2QBF by adopting a bias estimation strategy. Each round of BP allows the user to select the most biased \(\forall\) - variable and assign the biased value to the variable. After all the \(\forall\) - variables are assigned, the formula is simplified by the assignment and sent to SAT solvers. The procedure returns the assignment as a witness of unsatisfiability if the simplified formula is unsatisfiable, or UNKNOWN otherwise. However, the fact that BP is used for each \(\forall\) - variable assignment leads to high overhead, similar to the RL approach given by [5]. It is interesting, however, to see that with the added overhead, BP can find witnesses of unsatisfiability, which is what one- shot GNN- based embeddings cannot achieve.  

This manuscript revealed the previously unrecognized limitation of GNN in reasoning about unsatisfiability of SAT problems. This limitation is probably rooted in the simplicity of message- passing scheme, which is good enough for embedding graph features, but not for conducting complex reasoning on top of the graph structures.
