literals) is in the complexity class P, the Max2SAT problem is still NP- hard (Garey, Johnson, and Stockmeyer 1976), so even generating near- optimal solution for Max2SAT is not trivial.  

Moreover, despite GNNs have shown their effectiveness on SAT problem through experiments, the theoretical analysis about why they can work is still absent so far. Recently, there have been some theoretical research about learning to solve combinatorial problems with GNNs. (Xu et al. 2019) proves that the discriminative power of many popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and GraphSAGE, is not sufficient for the graph isomorphism problem. (Xu et al. 2020) proposes the algorithmic alignment theory to explain what reasoning tasks GNNs can learn well, and shows GNNs can align with dynamic programming algorithms. So, many classical reasoning tasks could be solved relatively well with a GNN model, such as visual question answering and shortest paths. However, it also raises an issue: as a polynomial- time procedure, any GNN model cannot align with an exact algorithm for NP- hard problems unless \(\mathrm{P} = \mathrm{NP}\) , whereas some approximation algorithms may be used to analyze the capability of GNNs to solve such problems. (Sato, Yamada, and Kashima 2019) has employed a class of distributed local algorithms to prove that GNNs can learn to solve some combinatorial optimization problems, such as minimum dominating set and minimum vertex cover, with some approximation ratios. These theoretical contributions provide a basis for us to further study the capability of GNNs on the MaxSAT problem.  

In this paper, we investigate the capability of GNNs in learning to solve MaxSAT problem both from theoretical and practical perspectives. Inspired from the algorithmic alignment theory, we design a distributed local algorithm for MaxSAT, which is guaranteed to have an approximation ratio of \(1 / 2\) . As the algorithm aligns well with a single- layer GNN, it can provide a theoretical explanation of the effect that a simple GNN can learn to solve MaxSAT problem to some extent. More importantly, for the first time, this work leverages GNNs to learn the solution of MaxSAT problem. Specifically, we build two typical GNN models, MS- NSFG and MS- ESFG, based on summarizing the common forms proposed for SAT, to investigate the capability of GNNs from the practical perspective. We have trained and tested both models on several random MaxSAT datasets in different settings. The experimental results demonstrate that both models have achieved pretty high accuracy on the testing sets, as well as the satisfactory generalization to larger and more difficult problems. This implies that GNNs are expected to be promising alternatives to improve the state- of- the- art solvers. We are hopeful that the results in this paper can provide preliminary knowledge about the capability of GNNs to solve MaxSAT problem, and become a basis for more theoretical and practical research in the future.  

The contributions can be summarized as follows:  

- We build two typical GNN models to solve MaxSAT problem, which is the first work to predict the solution of MaxSAT problem with GNNs in an end-to-end fashion.

- We analyze the capability of GNNs to solve MaxSAT problem theoretically, and prove that even a single-layer GNN can achieve the approximation ratio of \(1 / 2\) .- We evaluate the GNN models on several datasets of random MaxSAT instances with different distributions, and show that GNNs can achieve good performance and generalization on this task.  

## Preliminaries  

In this section, we firstly give the definition of SAT and MaxSAT problems, and then give an introduction to graph neural networks.  

## SAT and MaxSAT  

Given a set of Boolean variables \(\{x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots , x_{n}\}\) , a literal is either a variable \(x_{i}\) or its negation \(\neg x_{i}\) . A clause is a disjunction of literals, such as \(C_{1} \coloneqq x_{1} \vee \neg x_{2} \vee x_{3}\) . A propositional logic formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) is a conjunction of clauses, such as \(F \coloneqq C_{1} \wedge C_{2} \wedge C_{3}\) .  

For a CNF formula \(F\) , the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem is to find a truth assignment for each variable, such that all the clauses are satisfied (i.e., at least one literal in each clause is True). And the Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem is to find a truth assignment for each variable, such that the number of satisfied clauses is maximized. SAT and MaxSAT have long been proved to be NP- hard, which means there is no polynomial- time algorithm to solve them unless \(\mathrm{P} = \mathrm{NP}\) . Specifically, if every clause in \(F\) contains exactly \(k\) literals, the problem is called '\(k\) SAT' or 'Max\(k\) SAT'.  

There is a close relationship between MaxSAT and SAT. Firstly, MaxSAT can be seen as an optimization version of SAT, which can provide more information when handling over- constrained problems. Besides, many solving techniques that are effective in SAT have also been adapted
