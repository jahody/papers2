## A Datasets  

Generators. To generate high- quality SAT datasets that do not contain trivial instances, we have employed a rigorous process of selecting appropriate parameters for each CNF generator in G4SATBench. Table 7 provides detailed information about the generators we have used.

<table><tr><td>Dataset</td><td>Description</td><td>Parameters</td><td>Notes</td></tr><tr><td>SR</td><td>The SR dataset is composed of pairs of satisfiable and unsatisfiable formulas, with the only difference between each pair being the polarity of a single literal. Given the number of variables n, the synthetic generator iteratively samples k = 1+Bernoulli(b)+Geometric(g) vari-ables uniformly at random without replacement and negates each one with independent probability 50% to build a clause. This procedure continues until the generated formula is unsatisfiable. The satisfiable instance is then constructed by negating the first literal in the last clause of the unsatisfiable one.</td><td>General: b = 0.3, g = 0.4, Easy dataset: n ~ Uniform(10, 40), Medium dataset: n ~ Uniform(40, 200), Hard dataset: n ~ Uniform(200, 400)</td><td>The sampling parameters are the same as the original paper (Selsam et al., 2019).</td></tr><tr><td>3-SAT</td><td>The 3-SAT dataset comprises CNF formulas at the phase transition, where the proportion of generated satisfiable and unsatisfiable formu- las is roughly equal. Given the number of variables n and clauses m, the synthetic generator iteratively samples three variables (and their polarities) uniformly at random until m clauses are obtained.</td><td>General: m = 4.258n + 58.26n-2/3, Easy dataset: n ~ Uniform(10, 40), Medium dataset: n ~ Uniform(40, 200), Hard dataset: n ~ Uniform(200, 300)</td><td>The parameter m is the same as the paper (Crawford &amp;amp; Auton, 1996)</td></tr><tr><td>CA</td><td>The CA dataset contains SAT instances that are designed to mimic the community structures and modularity features found in real-world industrial instances. Given variable number n, clause number m, clause size k, community number c, and modularity Q, the synthetic generator iteratively selects k literals in the same community uni- formly at random with probability P = Q + 1/c and selects k literals in the distinct community uniformly at random with probability 1-P to build a clause and repeat for m times to construct a CNF formula.</td><td>General: m ~ Uniform(13n, 15n), k ~ Uniform(4, 5), c ~ Uniform(3, 10), Q ~ Uniform(0.7, 0.9) Easy dataset: n ~ Uniform(10, 40), Medium dataset: n ~ Uniform(40, 200), Hard dataset: n ~ Uniform(200, 400)</td><td>The parameters are selected based on the experiments in the original paper (Giráldez-Cru &amp;amp; Levy, 2015) and our study to ensure that the generated SAT instances have a balance of satisfiability and unsatisfiability.</td></tr><tr><td>PS</td><td>PS dataset encompasses SAT instances with a power-law distribution in the number of variable occurrences (popularity), and good class- tering between them (similarity). Given variable number n, clause number m, and average clause size k, the synthetic generator first as- signs random angles θi, θj ∈ [0, 2π] to each variable i and each clause j, and then randomly samples variable i in clause j with the proba- bility P = 1/(1+(iβjβi/R)T). Here, θij = π-|π-|θi-|θj| is the angle between variable i and clause j. The exponent parameters β and β′ control the power-law distribution of variable occurrences and clause size respectively. The temperature parameter T controls the sharpness of the probability distribution, while R is an approximate normalization constant that ensures the average number of selected edges is km.</td><td>General: m ~ Uniform(6n, 8n), k ~ Uniform(4, 5), β ~ Uniform(0, 1), β′ = 1, c ~ Uniform(3, 10), T ~ Uniform(0.75, 1.5) Easy dataset: n ~ Uniform(10, 40), Medium dataset: n ~ Uniform(40, 200), Hard dataset: n ~ Uniform(200, 300)</td><td>The parameters are selected based on the experiments in the original paper (Giráldez-Cru &amp;amp; Levy, 2017) and our study to ensure that the generated SAT instances have a balance of satisfiability and unsatisfiability.</td></tr><tr><td>k-Clique</td><td>The k-Clique dataset includes SAT instances that encode the k-Clique problem, which involves determining whether there exists a clique (i.e., a subset of vertices that are all adjacent to each other) with v vertices in a given graph. Given the number of cliques k, the synthetic generator produces an Erdős-Rényi graph with v vertices and a given edge probability p and then transforms the corresponding k-Clique problem into a SAT instance.</td><td>General: p = (v)k-1/(v), Easy dataset: v ~ Uniform(5, 15), k ~ Uniform(3, 4), Medium dataset: v ~ Uniform(15, 20), k ~ Uniform(3, 5), Hard dataset: v ~ Uniform(20, 25), k ~ Uniform(4, 6)</td><td>The parameter p is selected based on the paper (Bollobás &amp;amp; Erdős, 1976), making the expected number of k-Cliques in the generated graph equals 1.</td></tr><tr><td>k-Domset</td><td>The k-Domset dataset contains SAT instances that encode the k-Dominating Set problem. This problem is to determine whether there exists a dominating set (i.e., a subset of vertices such that every vertex in the graph is either in the subset or adjacent to a vertex in the sub- set) with at most k vertices in a given graph. Given the domination number k, the synthetic generator produces an Erdős-Rényi graph with v vertices and a given edge probability p and then transforms the corresponding k-Dominating Set problem into a SAT instance.</td><td>General: p = 1-(1-(v)k-1/(v)k), Easy dataset: v ~ Uniform(5, 15), k ~ Uniform(2, 3), Medium dataset: v ~ Uniform(15, 20), k ~ Uniform(3, 5), Hard dataset: v ~ Uniform(20, 25), k ~ Uniform(4, 6)</td><td>The parameter p is selected based on the paper (Wieland &amp;amp; Godbole, 2001), making the expected number of domination set with size k in the generated graph equals 1.</td></tr><tr><td>k-Vercov</td><td>The k-Vercov dataset consists of SAT instances that encode the k-Vercov problem, i.e., check whether there exists a set of k vertices in a graph such that every edge has at least one endpoint in this set. Given the vertex cover number k, the synthetic generator produces a complement graph of an Erdős-Rényi graph with v vertices and a given edge probability p and then converts the corresponding k-Vercov Cover problem into a SAT instance.</td><td>General: p = (v)k-1/(v), Easy dataset: v ~ Uniform(5, 15), k ~ Uniform(3, 5), Medium dataset: v ~ Uniform(10, 20), k ~ Uniform(6, 8), Hard dataset: v ~ Uniform(15, 25), k ~ Uniform(9, 10)</td><td>The generation process and the parameter are selected based on the relationship between k-Vercov Cover and k-Clique problems, making the size of the minimum vertex cover in the generated graph around k.</td></tr></table>
