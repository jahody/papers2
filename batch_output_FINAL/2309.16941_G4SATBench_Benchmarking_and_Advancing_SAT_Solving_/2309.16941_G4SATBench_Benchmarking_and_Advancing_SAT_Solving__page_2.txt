predicts marginal distributions of all satisfying solutions to solve the SAT problem. Moreover, most previous research has experimented on different datasets that vary in a range of settings (e.g., data distribution, instance size, and dataset size), which leads to a lack of unified and standardized datasets for training and evaluation. Additionally, some work (Amizadeh et al., 2019b; Shi et al., 2023; Yan et al., 2023) has noted the difficulty of re- implementing prior approaches as baselines, rendering it arduous to draw consistent conclusions about the performance of peer methods. All of these issues impede the development of GNN- based solvers for SAT solving.  

To systematically quantify the progress in this field and facilitate rapid, reproducible, and generalizable research, we propose G4SATBench, the first comprehensive benchmark study for SAT solving with GNNs. G4SATBench is characterized as follows:  

- First, we construct a large and diverse collection of SAT datasets that includes instances from distinct sources and difficulty levels. Specifically, our benchmark consists of 7 different datasets from 3 benchmark families, including random instances, pseudo-industrial instances, and combinatorial problems. It not only covers a wide range of prior datasets but also introduces 3 levels of difficulty for each dataset to enable fine-grained analyses.  

- Second, we re-implement various GNN-based SAT solvers with unified interfaces and configuration settings, establishing a general evaluation protocol for fair and comprehensive comparisons. Our framework allows for evaluating different GNN models in SAT solving with various prediction tasks, training objectives, and inference algorithms, encompassing the diverse learning frameworks employed in the existing literature.  

- Third, we present baseline results and conduct thorough analyses of GNN-based SAT solvers, providing a detailed reference of prior work and laying a solid foundation for future research. Our evaluations assess the performances of different choices of GNN models (e.g., graph constructions, message-passing schemes) with particular attention to some critical parameters (e.g., message-passing iterations), as well as their generalization ability across different distributions.  

- Lastly, we conduct a series of in-depth experiments to explore the learning abilities of GNN-based SAT solvers. Specifically, we compare the training and solving processes of GNNs with the heuristics employed in both CDCL and LS-based SAT solvers. Our experimental results reveal that GNNs tend to develop a solving heuristic similar to greedy local search to find a satisfying assignment but fail to effectively learn the CDCL heuristic in the latent space.  

We believe that G4SATBench will help the research community to make significant strides in understanding the capabilities and limitations of GNNs for solving SAT and facilitate further endeavors in this domain.

SAT solving with GNNs. Existing GNN- based SAT solvers can be broadly categorized into two branches (Holden et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2022): standalone neural solvers and neural- guided solvers. Standalone neural solvers utilize GNNs to solve SAT instances directly. For example, a stream of research (Bünz & Lamm, 2017; Selsam et al., 2019; Jaszczur et al., 2020; Cameron et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2023) focuses on predicting the satisfiability of a given formula, while several alternative approaches (Amizadeh et al., 2019a;b; Ozolins et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Yan et al., 2023) aim to construct a satisfying assignment. Neural- guided solvers, on the other hand, integrate GNNs with modern SAT solvers, trying to improve their search heuristics with the prediction of GNNs. These methods typically train GNN models using supervised learning on some tasks such as unsat- core variable prediction (Selsam & Bjørner, 2019; Wang et al., 2021), satisfying assignment prediction (Zhang et al., 2020), glue variable prediction (Han, 2020), and assignment marginal prediction (Li & Si, 2022), or through reinforcement learning (Yolcu & Póczos, 2019; Kurin et al., 2020) by modeling the entire search procedure as a Markov decision process. Despite the rich literature on SAT solving with GNNs, there is no benchmark study to evaluate and compare the performance of these GNN models. We hope the proposed G4SATBench would address this gap.
