For learning a branching heuristic to find a dominating clique, our training data contains 2650 instances generated from \(G(n,p)\) with the range of \(n\) being from 75 to 800. Among these instances, 1250 instances are generated from \(G(n,p)\) with \(p\) being around 0.371 as hard instances. The remaining 1400 instances are generated from \(G(n,p)\) with \(p \in (0,0.35) \cup (0.4,1)\) . we call them easy instances as they are generated outside the phase transition and relatively easier to be solved. We use 750 hard instances and all easy instances as our training data. The remaining 500 hard instances are used as validation data and test data.  

For learning a branching heuristic to find the minimum dominating clique, we create another 1250 instances (750 instances are used in training data, and the remaining 500 instances are used as validation data and test data) from \(G(n,p)\) to replace the hard instances. The range of \(n\) of these new instances is the same as the hard instances above, but the range of \(p\) is between 0.4 and 0.41. The reason is that if a graph is dense, there are many dominating cliques with minimum size. If so, commonly used branching heuristics are powerful enough because the first- found solution is usually the minimum solution. Therefore, we choose this range of \(p\) to generate the instances such that they have some dominating cliques but only few of these dominating cliques with minimum size. Additionally, we keep the same easy instances above in the training data for finding the minimum dominating clique.  

## D Raw Experimental Results for Finding Dominating Cliques  

We run three solvers, the original solver in [9] (abbreviated as O) and the other two GNN- enhanced solvers with the fast and accurate calculations for joint information entropy (abbreviated as F and A) respectively on the training, validation, and test data where \(p\) is around 0.371. We compare the number of branches of their search trees. Table 2 shows the results on the training data. Tables 3 and 4 show the results on the validation and test data respectively. The columns O vs F, O vs A, and A vs F record the number of times that the corresponding solver wins. The Avg columns are the arithmetic average of the number of branches. The numbers in brackets are the results of the instances that dominating cliques exist.
