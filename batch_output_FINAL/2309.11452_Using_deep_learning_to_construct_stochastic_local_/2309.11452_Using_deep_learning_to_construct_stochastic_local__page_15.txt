<center>Figure 9: Benchmark of our ml-boosted version of WalkSAT algorithm (green) against its uniform version (orange) a) + b): mean (see a)) and median (see b)) number of steps needed (y-axis) for instances of the evaluation dataset with a certain clauses to variables ratio \(\alpha\) (x-axis). Note that \(10^{6}\) steps means that the algorithm has reached its time limit and has not found a solution. c): percentage of instances of the evaluation dataset solved within \(10^{6}\) steps (y-axis) with a certain clauses to variables ratio \(\alpha\) (x-axis). d): benchmark of the steps taken by uniform version of WalkSAT algorithm (x-axis) against the ml-boosted version of it (y-axis). The color of the dots indicates the corresponding clauses-to-variables ratio \(\alpha\) . e): mean number of clauses violated (y-axis) as a function of the number of steps the algorithm has taken (x-axis). f): ratio of solved instances (y-axis) as a function of the number of steps the algorithm has taken. </center>
