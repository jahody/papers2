## 4 Results  

We compare three different variants of both for the MT- algorithm and for WalkSAT, namely  

- the original version that uses the uniform oracle,- a "hybrid" version that uses the trained oracle just for initialization and then switches to uniform updating, and- the full oracle-based algorithm that uses the oracle for both initialization and updating.  

In Table 1, we provide a summary of the results. We find that for both solvers, the full oracle- based algorithm outperforms both others across the board. Moreover, the WalkSAT algorithm dominates the MT algorithm on each of the variants. A particularly dramatic improvement is seen in terms of the median steps required, where the boosted MT algorithm is faster by a factor of more than 8, while the boosted WalkSAT provides a speed- up by a factor of around 5. This indicates that the boosted solvers are especially powerful when solving relatively simple instances. A less dramatic but still significant improvement is seen in the mean number of steps, where we see an average decrease of \(35\%\) across solvers.
