Maximum Independent Set (MIS) Problem Given a graph \(\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})\) , the maximum independent set problem aims to find a node set \(\mathcal{S}\) with a maximal number of nodes where there are no edges between any two nodes in this set. The objective function and constraint conditions of the maximum independent set problem can be denoted as:  

\[\begin{array}{l}{f(\mathcal{S}) = \sum_{v_{i}\in \mathcal{V}}v_{i},}\\ {v_{i} + v_{j}\leqslant 1|\forall e_{i,j}\in \mathcal{E},} \end{array} \quad (3.3a)\]  

where \(v_{i} = 1\) when \(v_{i} \in \mathcal{S}\) and \(v_{i} = 0\) otherwise.  

Minimum Dominated Set (MDS) Problem Given a graph \(\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})\) , the goal of the minimum dominated set problem is to find a dominated set \(\mathcal{S}\) where each node \(v_{i} \in \mathcal{V}\) or at least one of its neighbor nodes belongs to the dominated set \(\mathcal{S}\) . The number of nodes in \(\mathcal{S}\) should also be minimized. The objective function and constraint conditions of the minimum dominated set problem can be denoted as:  

\[\begin{array}{l}{f(\mathcal{S}) = -\sum_{v_{i}\in \mathcal{V}}v_{i},}\\ {v_{i} + v_{j}\geqslant 1|e_{i,j}\in \mathcal{E},\forall v_{i}\in \mathcal{V},} \end{array} \quad (3.4a)\]  

where \(v_{i} = 1\) when \(v_{i} \in \mathcal{S}\) and \(v_{i} = 0\) otherwise.  

### 3.2 Problem Transfer via Max-SAT Problem  

In this subsection, we introduce the details of leveraging the Max- SAT problem to bridge different CO problems. In general, to fully utilize the common logical information in COs, we first convert the original graphs of the CO problems into several clauses of Max- SAT problems and then transform these clauses into bipartite graphs.  

#### 3.2.1 From Graph to Clauses  

Given a graph from any CO, we use clauses with variables to describe the objective function and the constraint conditions. Max- SAT is an optimization problem that contains a set of clauses and variables. Define \(m\) clauses \(\mathcal{C} = \{c_{1},c_{2},\dots ,c_{m}\}\) and \(n\) variables \(\mathcal{X} = \{x_{1},x_{2},\dots ,x_{n}\}\) , the Max- SAT problem is to find a truth assignment of variables so that the number of satisfied clauses is maximized.  

To generate clauses, we define two rules for the objective function and constraint conditions respectively. The soft rule is based on the objective function and the hard rule is based on the constraint conditions. The difference between those two rules mainly lies in whether the clauses should be strictly satisfied. For clarification, we let the variable \(x_{i}\) correspond to the node \(v_{i}\) in graph \(\mathcal{G}\) . For demonstration purposes, we provide the details of transformations for Max- Cut, MIS, and MDS problems.  

For every \(v_{i} \in \mathcal{V}\) in MIS problems, the clauses are generated by:  

\[\begin{array}{l}{c_{h} = \neg x_{i}\vee \neg x_{j}|e_{i,j}\in \mathcal{E},}\\ {c_{s} = x_{i}|v_{i}\in \mathcal{V},} \end{array} \quad (3.5a)\]  

where \(c_{h} \in \mathcal{C}_{h}\) denotes the hard clause which describes that the set cannot contain the node and its neighbors at the same time, \(c_{s} \in \mathcal{C}_{s}\) denotes the soft clause which describes that the number of nodes in the MIS problem should be maximized, \(\neg\) and \(\vee\) are the negation and disjunction.  

For every \(v_{i} \in \mathcal{V}\) in MDS problems, the clauses are generated by:  

\[\begin{array}{l}{c_{h} = x_{i}\vee x_{j}|e_{i,j}\in \mathcal{E},}\\ {c_{s} = \neg x_{i}|v_{i}\in \mathcal{V},} \end{array} \quad (3.6a)\]  

where \(c_{h} \in \mathcal{C}_{h}\) describes that the node or at least one of its neighbor nodes belongs to MDS, and \(c_{s} \in \mathcal{C}_{s}\) describes that the number of nodes in MDS should be minimized.
