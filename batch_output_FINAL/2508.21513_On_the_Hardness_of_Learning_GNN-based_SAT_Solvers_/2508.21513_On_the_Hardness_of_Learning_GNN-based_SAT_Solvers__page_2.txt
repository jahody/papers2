compressed into finite- dimensional embeddings. This bottleneck severely restricts the ability of GNNs to model long- range dependencies, and can be thought of as a vanishing gradient problem.  

Given that the difficulty of SAT can actually be understood intuitively as being proportional to the number of long- range dependencies between nodes, we question whether learning GNN- based solvers on these difficult problems is impacted by oversquashing. Recent geometric analyses propose that oversquashing is directly tied to negative Ricci Curvature (RC) of the underlying graph [38, 47]. These insights invite a fundamental question: Can graph RC serve as a predictive and constructive notion in unraveling novel hardness concepts for GNN- based SAT solvers?  

In this work, we address this question by studying the typical- case behavior of particular instantiations of graph RC on random \(k\) - SAT problems represented as bipartite graphs. Our starting point is the observation that edges of bipartite graphs are always non- positively curved. We show that, on average, the edges become more negatively curved as problems get harder, and less negatively curved as they become easier. Finally, we derive an exact expression for the average Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC) in the limit of unsolvable problems, from which we derive a connection between curvature and oversquashing in GNNs- based SAT solvers, following the theory of Topping et al. [47]. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful attempt at a theoretical characterization of the limitations of GNN- based SAT solvers.  

To validate our theory, we perform experiments on random 3- and 4- SAT problems, and also on a vast array of datasets coming from the recent benchmark of Li et al. [28]. Firstly, we observe a phase transition- like phenomenon in random 3- SAT solving probability as a function of the mean and variance of the curvature. We further affirm the aforementioned limitations by rewiring only the testing graphs of the benchmarks at test- time to increase their average BFC, and show that these rewired problems become much easier to solve. Finally, we find that heuristics based on the BFC of a dataset correlate extremely well with generalization error, unlike the average clause density, which is typically used to characterize the hardness of a single instance. Overall, our findings suggest that GNN- based SAT solvers have two distinct types of hardness: the hardness of learning representations in negatively curved structures, followed by the well- established algorithmic hardness of SAT. We conclude by relating our findings with modeling principles and design choices of existing approaches.  

Outline. The remainder of this article is structured as follows: In Section 2, we provide a recap of the most relevant concepts discussed in the paper: random \(k\) - SAT, GNNs, and graph RC. Section 3.1 presents the main theoretical results, including an in- depth discussion on how oversquashing affects GNNs- based solvers. We then demonstrate the experimental evidence in Section 4. Finally, we provide a discussion regarding current design principles and future work in Section 5.  

## 2 Background  

This section is only intended to formally introduce the objects studied in the paper and render the material self- contained. We kindly ask the reader to tolerate the occasional whirlwind and abuse of notation, as it will be formalized later in Section 3.  

### 2.1 Random \(k\) Boolean Satisfiability Problem  

The random \(k\) - SAT (assignment) problem, which is the central object of study in this work, is made up of \(N\) variables \(\{x_{i}\}_{i = 1}^{N}\) that can take binary values \(x_{i} \in \{0,1\}\) . Using these variables, one constructs \(M\) clauses containing a disjunction of \(k\) variables or their negations (called literals). For example, a 3- SAT problem would have clauses of the form \((x_{i} \vee \neg x_{j} \vee x_{h})\) . The goal is to assign a value to all literals such that they satisfy the conjunction of all clauses. This logical formula is called a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). In the random formulation, it is possible to identify different phases of problem hardness based on a parameter called the clause density \(\alpha = M / N\) . This phenomenon has been actively researched in statistical physics due to the analogies between random \(k\) - SAT and spin- glass models [33, 34]. Notable results[26, 37, 50] include the discovery of two transitions for typical instances at a given \(k\) , based on the value of \(\alpha\) in the thermodynamic limit \((M, N \to \infty)\) : As \(\alpha\) increases, the measure over the space of possible solutions first decomposes into an exponential number of clusters at the dynamical transition \(\alpha_{d}(k)\) and subsequently condensates over the largest such states at the critical transition \(\alpha_{c}(k)\) . These phase transitions naturally affect the performances of many algorithms, e.g., when \(k \geq 4\) , going beyond \(\alpha_{c}\) is almost impossible with existing algorithms.
