<center>Figure 6: Visualization of a hard, in terms of clause density \(\alpha\) , random 3-SAT problem with 256 variables in (a) bipartite and (b) circular layouts. There is a very large number of long-range interactions, as can clearly be seen in (b). Furthermore, for such large \(\alpha\) , the average BFC is strongly negative, in line with the developed theory. </center>  

<center>Figure 7: Average BFC as a function of \(\alpha\) for random 3 and 4 -SAT problems with \(N = 256\) . The size of the blobs is used as a representation for the average solvability of the problems at a given \(\alpha\) by the NeuroSAT model [46]. The vertical red line represents the analytical SAT-UNSAT critical threshold \(\alpha_{c}\) [32]. The average BFC drops monotonically with \(\alpha\) in both cases. For 3-SAT (a), this drop appears to be almost linear, with a substantial amount of variance, as also depicted in Figure 2. 4-SAT on the other hand contains problems where the curvature is substantially more negative and concentrated, which when coupled with the larger number of constraints leads to oversquashing, as discussed in our theory. This can be clearly seen by the fast performance drop-off in (b), which happens much earlier than \(\alpha_{c}\) , indicating the additional hardness phase related to representation learning discussed in the main paper. </center>
