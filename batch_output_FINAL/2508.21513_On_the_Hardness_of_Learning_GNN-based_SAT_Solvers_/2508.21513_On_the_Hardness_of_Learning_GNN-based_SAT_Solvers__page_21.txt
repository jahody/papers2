<center>Figure 8: Analogue of Figure 2a for 4-SAT. Average BFC as a function of \(\alpha\) for random 4-SAT problems with \(N = 256\) . The color is used as a representation for the average solvability of the problems at a given \(\alpha\) by the NeuroSAT model, with a group labeled as solvable if \(50\%\) or more of the problems get a satisfying assignment. The vertical red line represents the analytical SAT-UNSAT critical threshold \(\alpha_{c} \approx 9.931\) [32]. The average BFC is negative and drops with \(\alpha\) , but for a small amount. The plot in the top-right corner shows the model's solution probability curve as a function of \(\alpha\) , where it is possible to notice that the GNN-based solver has severe limitations on these problems. Differently from 3-SAT (Figure 2a), the average curvature is negative and concentrated even for problems that would be considered very simple in terms of \(\alpha\) ( \(\alpha \rightarrow 8\) ). This is due to the larger value of \(k\) , the higher number of long-range interactions, and the connection of both factors with oversquashing, as discussed and predicted by our contributions. </center>
