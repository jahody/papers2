Proposition 3.1. Let \(i\sim j\) be an edge from the LCG representation \(G\) of a random k- SAT problem with \(N\) variables and \(M\) clauses, with degree distributions given by Equations 6 and 3. Then \(\mathbb{E}_{(i\sim j)}[\kappa (i,j)]\to 0\) and \(\mathbb{E}_{(i\sim j)}[Ric(i,j)]\to 0\) as \(\alpha = \frac{M}{N}\to 0\) .  

Proposition 3.1 tells us that as problems get easier, i.e., they are in the satisfiable phase, their graph representations get (Ricci) flatter. This statement implies a relationship between very simple problems and their bipartite topology, which is that each clause is made of distinct literals. In this scenario, producing a satisfying assignment becomes trivial since assigning truth values to these unique literals does not affect other clauses. This implication aligns well with common knowledge, therefore the next thing to check is whether there is an opposite behavior when dealing with very difficult problems. This later case is important because it is close to the unsatisfiable phase where the faults of existing algorithms emerge [2]. Through a similar argument as before, we can formalize this intuition and characterize the average lower bound in the case when problems are surely unsatisfiable.  

Proposition 3.2. Let \(i\sim j\) be an edge from the LCG representation \(G\) of a random k- SAT problem with \(N\) variables and \(M\) clauses, with degree distributions given by Equations 6 and 3. Then \(\mathbb{E}_{(i\sim j)}[\bar{R} (i,j)]\to \frac{2}{k} - 2\) as \(\alpha = \frac{M}{N}\to \infty\) .  

In this scenario, the average lower bound of the graph RC will tend to be maximally negative, therefore we cannot directly speak on the average curvature by sandwiching as before. Nevertheless, Proposition 3.2 provides an extremely interesting insight into the interplay between \(\alpha\) and \(k\) . As the problems get harder, the number of constraints (i.e., \(k\) ) becomes a decisive factor on the curvature. A larger value of \(k\) implies more constraints and thus many long range interactions between the literals, but it also implies that edges will become more negatively curved. In turn, this implies the existence of bottlenecks in the graph, which makes long range communication becomes difficult [47]. While it is not possible to connect the exact graph OC to this result, it is possible to extend it to the average graph BFC:  

Theorem 3.1. Let \(i\sim j\) be an edge from the LCG representation \(G\) of a random k- SAT problem with \(N\) variables and \(M\) clauses, with degree distributions given by Equations 6 and 3. The BFC at \(i\sim j\) is bounded from above by the quantity:  

\[\bar{R} (i,j)\coloneqq \frac{2}{d_{i}} +\frac{2}{d_{j}} -2 + \frac{d_{i} + k - 2}{\max \{k - 1,M - 1\} \max \{d_{i},d_{j}\}}. \quad (10)\]  

Furthermore, as \(\alpha = \frac{M}{N}\to \infty\) , \(\mathbb{E}_{(i\sim j)}[\bar{R} (i,j)]\to \frac{2}{k} - 2\) and therefore the average BFC over the edges of \(G\) converges to \(\mathbb{E}_{(i\sim j)}[Ric(i,j)]\to \frac{2}{k} - 2\) .  

Theorem 3.1 contains a crucial result in its characterization of the typical- case BFC, which is that it is connected to both \(\alpha\) and \(k\) . While the connection to \(\alpha\) might seem obvious, the one with \(k\) is quite insightful. One can observe that as problems become harder to satisfy (large values of \(\alpha\) ), \(k\) plays an important role in how negatively curved the graph edges can become. This phenomenon can be seen in Figure 1, where for smaller \(k\) , larger values of \(\alpha\) are required to have highly negatively curved edges. This latter point is crucial in developing a more profound understanding of the limitations of GNN- based solvers, and we will expand upon it in the following subsection. Another interesting consequence of our results, is that due to their shared lower bound and the results in Propositions 3.1 and 3.2, we confirm a tight link between graph OC and BFC. In general, the correlation between graph OC and FC has been studied in great detail on an array of complex networks by Samal et al. [44]. In our case, we confirm that both OC and BFC discretizations behave identically for simpler problems and similarly in relation to \(\alpha\) and \(k\) , a phenomenon that can also be verified empirically through Figures 1 and 4 (Appendix).  

### 3.1 Message-Passing Bottlenecks and Downstream Performance  

The results presented in the previous section allow us to proceed with a principled way of understanding performance limitations in GNN- based SAT solvers. This is due to the direct connection between the result in Theorem 3.1 to Theorem 4 of Topping et al. [47], which establishes that "edges with high negative curvature are those causing the graph bottleneck and thus leading to the oversquashing phenomenon". This seminal result states that if the gradients of the message passing functions ( \(\theta\) and \(\phi\) in Equation 1) are bounded, and there exists a sufficiently negatively curved edge compared to the degrees of its endpoints, then the derivative of the learned node representations around that edge vanishes. Intuitively, this can be understood as a difficulty of propagating the information in nodes at a reachable distance due to the fact that the graph structure limits the pathways where
