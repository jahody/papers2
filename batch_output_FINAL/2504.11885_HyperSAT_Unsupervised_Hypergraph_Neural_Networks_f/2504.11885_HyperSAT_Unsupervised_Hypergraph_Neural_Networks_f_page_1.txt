## Abstract  

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance in solving both Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problems due to their ability to efficiently model and capture the structural dependencies between literals and clauses. However, GNN methods for solving Weighted MaxSAT problems remain underdeveloped. The challenges arise from the non- linear dependency and sensitive objective function, which are caused by the non- uniform distribution of weights across clauses. In this paper, we present HyperSAT, a novel neural approach that employs an unsupervised hypergraph neural network model to solve Weighted MaxSAT problems. We propose a hypergraph representation for Weighted MaxSAT instances and design a cross- attention mechanism along with a shared representation constraint loss function to capture the logical interactions between positive and negative literal nodes in the hypergraph. Extensive experiments on various Weighted MaxSAT datasets demonstrate that HyperSAT achieves better performance than state- of- the- art competitors.  

## 1. Introduction  

The Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem is a fundamental computational problem that asks whether there exists an assignment of true or false values to a set of variables such that a given propositional Boolean formula evaluates to true. It is the first problem proven to be NP- complete (Cook, 1971) and has important applications in various fields, including planning (Kautz et al., 1992), hardware and software verification (Clarke et al., 2001), and cryptanalysis (Sun et al.,  

2020). The Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem and its generalization, the Weighted MaxSAT problem, are the variants of SAT with a goal of maximizing the number of satisfied clauses or their weighted sum. By incorporating the notion of prioritizing or weighing different clauses, the Weighted MaxSAT problem provides a more general and flexible version of SAT and MaxSAT to tackle a wide range of real- world problems, such as scheduling (Thornton & Sattar, 1998), action model learning (Yang et al., 2007), computational protein design (Allouche et al., 2012) and resource allocation (Timm & Botha, 2022).  

Over the past several decades, SAT problems and their extensions have become central topics in computational logic and theoretical computer science. A wide array of solvers has been developed, with most of them relying on meticulously designed search algorithms (Audemard & Simon, 2018; Cai & Zhang, 2021; Biere & Fleury, 2022). With the rapid progress of deep learning, there has been a growing shift towards developing learning- based solvers. These learning- based methods aim to effectively extract hidden structures within problem instances and uncover underlying patterns from the data, thus reducing reliance on manually crafted and domain- specific strategies, and providing more adaptable and scalable solvers to tackle large and complex problem instances.  

Specifically, the applications of deep learning techniques to SAT problems have led to two main classes of approaches: end- to- end neural solvers and neural- guided solvers. The end- to- end approaches are typically designed to predict satisfiability or optimal assignments directly from the raw problem input. For example, the groundbreaking work NeuroSAT (Selsam et al., 2019) introduced an end- to- end framework that predicts satisfiability on random instances using a message passing neural network (MPNN). The study by (Cameron et al., 2020) represented SAT instances as permutation- invariant sparse matrices and compared the performances of the exchangeable architecture and MPNN. For the first time, it was demonstrated that end- to- end learning methods could achieve competitive performance in terms of satisfiability prediction. QuerySAT (Ozolins et al., 2022) proposed a neural SAT solver with a query mechanism that allows the network to make multiple solution trials and get feedback on the loss value towards better solutions.
