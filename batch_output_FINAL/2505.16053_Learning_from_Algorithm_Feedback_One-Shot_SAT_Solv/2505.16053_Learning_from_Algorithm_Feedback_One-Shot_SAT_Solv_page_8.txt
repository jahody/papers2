### 3.2 Comparison to Supervised Approaches  

Prior work suggests predicting predefined variable properties, such as UNSAT core Selsam and Bjørner (2019) or backbone Wang et al. (2024) membership, in a supervised manner, and then transforming model predictions into variable weights and polarities for solver guidance. Here, we aim to compare how guidance learned with RLAF compares to this approach. Note that the notions of UNSAT cores and backbones are only sensible training targets for some instance distributions. Backbones can only be non- empty on satisfiable instances, and even for satisfiable graph coloring problems, all backbones are empty due to the permutation symmetry of the vertex colors. Furthermore, on our UNSAT 3SAT training instances, we observed that the UNSAT core extracted by SAT solvers contained all variables on almost all instances, yielding a training target that is effectively constant. Due to these limitations, we use the 3SAT instances to evaluate the effectiveness of predicting the backbone, while we use the graph coloring and cryptographic instances to compare RLAF to core- based solver guidance. For a fair comparison, we use the same GNN architecture used to train with RLAF and train a separate model for each instance distribution. The transformation that maps the backbone/core predictions to variable weights is tuned separately for each instance distribution on the corresponding validation set. Full details about the setup of this comparison are provided in Appendix B.4.  

Figure 4 compares the results for Glucose in terms of the relative wall- clock runtime compared to the base solver. Overall, the policy learned with RLAF significantly outperforms solver guidance based on both UNSAT core and backbone predictions by achieving a smaller relative runtime. The backbone- based heuristic outperforms RLAF only on satisfiable 3SAT instances with 300 variables, but not on larger problems. On unsatisfiable 3SAT problems, the backbone- guided heuristic performs substantially worse. RLAF also outperforms core- based guidance for both graph coloring and cryptographic SAT problems. Overall, these results demonstrate that pure RL- based learning with RLAF can yield more effective solver guidance than predicting handcrafted notions of variable importance in a supervised manner.  

### 3.3 Exploring Learned Variable Weights  

We further aim to gain insights into the weight distributions learned through RLAF. In particular, we investigate whether the policies learned with different base solvers are related and whether they capture predefined variable properties, such as backbone and UNSAT core membership. To this end, Figure 5 compares the weights for 5000 randomly selected variables from the corresponding validation sets. Specifically, we plot the expected variable weight \(\mathbb{E}[w(x)]\) for the Glucose- trained policy on the x- axis and plot the corresponding value for the March- trained policy on the y- axis. We also report the Pearson correlation coefficient \((r)\) for these weights to quantify their correlation. For 3SAT, we only plot variables from satisfiable instances and additionally indicate whether each variable belongs to its instance's backbone. Likewise, we focus on unsatisfiable instances for 3COL and CRYPTO and indicate if a variable occurs in the UNSAT core extracted for the experiment in Section 3.2.  

We observe that the variable weights of the two policies are generally correlated, with a Pearson correlation coefficient \(r\) between 0.73 and 0.85. This indicates that the learned weightings capture structural properties that are inherent to the variables and accelerate the search across different
