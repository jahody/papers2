## 10.1 ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  

10.1 ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RESULTSThe scatter plots is another commonly used plot in the SAT community for comparing the solving effectiveness of two solvers on each problem. Fig. 5 shows the scatter plots of NeuroBack- Kissat and its two baseline solvers, Default- Kissat and Random- Kissat. It is evident that more dots are present in the lower triangular area, indicating that there are more problems on which NeuroBack- Kissat outperforms both Default- Kissat and Random- Kissat. Specifically, NeuroBack- Kissat outperforms Default- Kissat on 43 and 40 additional problems in SATCOMP- 2022 and SATCOMP- 2023, respectively, reducing solving time by 117 and 36 seconds per problem. Similarly, NeuroBack- Kissat outperforms Random- Kissat in SATCOMP- 2022 and SATCOMP- 2023 on 22 and 29 more problems, respectively, leading to a reduction in solving time of 98 and 246 seconds per problem.  

## 10.2 PERFORMANCE ON SOLVED SAT AND UNSAT PROBLEMS  

Upon detailed analysis, for 661 problems from both SATCOMP- 2022 and SATCOMP- 2023 testing sets, there are 194 unsat problems and 216 sat problems that are solved by either Default- Kissat or NeuroBack- Kissat. For the 194 solved unsat problems, NeuroBack- Kissat outperformed Default- Kissat in 121 cases (62.4%) while Default- Kissat outperformed NeuroBack- Kissat in only 61 problems (31.4%). For the 216 solved sat problems, NeuroBack- Kissat outperformed Default- Kissat in 110 problems (50.9%), while Default- Kissat outperformed NeuroBack- Kissat in 87 problems (40.3%). While NeuroBack- Kissat showed a higher improvement rate in unsat problems compared to sat ones (62.4% vs 50.9%), the extent of improvement was more significant in sat problems. On average, NeuroBack- Kissat enhanced the performance of sat problems by 53.2%, compared to an average improvement of only 14.6% in unsat problems. These trends were similarly observed when comparing NeuroBack- Kissat with Random- Kissat.  

The experimental results highlight two key aspects. First, they demonstrate that NeuroBack's predicted variable phases can enhance the efficiency in solving unsat problems. Our explanation is that NeuroBack's phase predictions can aid in directing the search towards the unsatisfiable part of the search space. While NeuroBack cannot satisfy all components of a given SAT problem, it may predict phases that satisfy certain components, thereby allowing the solver to concentrate on the unsat part. Furthermore, in modern SAT solvers such as Default- Kissat Biere & Fleury (2020), an assignment that falsifies the fewer clauses is often preferred in the searching loop, allowing the solver to specifically target the unsat portions of the clause set. Consequently, the phases predicted by NeuroBack can facilitate identifying an assignment that reduces clause falsification, thereby enhancing solving unsat problems.  

Second, the experimental results also show that NeuroBack achieves a more pronounced improvement in solving sat problems than in solving unsat problems. This distinction stems from the inherent nature of these problems. In sat problems, a complete satisfying assignment exists, where each variable is assigned a phase that leads to a solution. Conversely, in unsat problems, only partial satisfying assignments exist, with phases assigned to just a subset of variables. Consequently, the phases predicted by NeuroBack have a generally greater impact in resolving sat problems. This is because, for these problems, the predicted phases can contribute directly to finding a satisfying
