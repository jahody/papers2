<center>Figure 4: Progress of Default-Kissat, Random-Kissat, and NeuroBack-Kissat over time in solving problems (time in seconds) on SATCOMP-2022 (left) and SATCOMP-2023 (right), respectively. NeuroBack-Kissat outperforms the two baseline solvers on both testing sets. </center>  

353 problems from SATCOMP- 2023 were successfully inferred. The CPU inference time for each of these problems ranged from 0.3 to 16.5 seconds, averaging at 1.7 seconds. Given that problems unsuccessfully inferred make the NeuroBack solver revert to its baseline, we exclude such problems from our evaluation of how NeuroBack contributes to SAT solving.  

As a result, for 308 inferred problems in SATCOMP- 2022, Default- Kissat and Random- Kissat solved 193 and 197 problems, respectively. In comparison, NeuroBack- Kissat solved 203 problems, representing an improvement of \(5.2\%\) over Default- Kissat and \(3.0\%\) over Random- Kissat, respectively. For 353 inferred problems in SATCOMP- 2023, Default- Kissat and Random- Kissat successfully solved 198 and 190 problems, respectively. In contrast, NeuroBack- Kissat solved 204 problems, making improvements of \(3.0\%\) and \(7.4\%\) over Default- Kissat and Random- Kissat, respectively.  

The cactus plot is a commonly used plot in the SAT community for demonstrating the solving, as shown in Fig. 4. Random- Kissat performs better than Default- Kissat in SATCOMP- 2022, but worse in SATCOMP- 2023. In contrast, NeuroBack- Kissat consistently outperforms both baseline solvers. Specifically, NeuroBack- Kissat outperforms Default- Kissat on 43 and 40 additional problems in SATCOMP- 2022 and SATCOMP- 2023, respectively, reducing solving time by 117 and 36 seconds per problem. Similarly, NeuroBack- Kissat outperforms Random- Kissat in SATCOMP- 2022 and SATCOMP- 2023 on 22 and 29 more problems, respectively, reducing solving time by 98 and 246 seconds per problem. For additional results, please refer to the Appendix section. Overall, results suggest that the phase initialization provided by NeuroBack outperforms both the default and random phase initializations in Kissat, exhibiting enhanced proficiency in solving SATCOMP- 2022 and SATCOMP- 2023 problems.  

## 7 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK  

The current implementation of NeuroBack has two main aspects to improve. First, pre- training the GNN model requires a large amount of data. Once trained, however, the model is able to easily generalize to new problem categories, so the investment in putting together a large dataset is warranted. The dataset will also be publicly available to benefit future research. Second, this paper employs neural phase predictions solely as an initial setting for variable phases in SAT solvers. However, multiple methods exist to utilize these predictions in SAT, either in a static or dynamic manner, which are likely to yield further performance enhancements. For instance, phase predictions could be leveraged dynamically during rephasing to adjust or diversify the exploration of the search space.  

## 8 CONCLUSION  

This paper proposes a machine learning approach, NeuroBack, to make CDCL SAT solvers more effective without requiring any GPU resource during its application. The main idea is to make offline model inference on variable phases appearing in the majority of satisfying assignments, for enhancing the phase selection heuristic in CDCL solvers. Incorporated in the state- of- the- art SAT solver, Kissat, this approach significantly reduces the solving time and makes it possible to solve more instances in SATCOMP- 2022 and SATCOMP- 2023. NeuroBack is thus a promising approach to improving the SAT solvers through machine learning.
