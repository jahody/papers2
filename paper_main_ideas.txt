Paper ID: 2110.14053
Title: 2110.14053 NeuroBack Improving CDCL SAT Solving using Graph N

Main Idea:
  Propositional satisfiability (SAT) is an NP- complete problem that impacts many research fields, such as planning, verification, and security. Aiming to make GNN improvements practical, this paper proposes an approach called NeuroBack, which builds on two insights: (1) predicting phases (i.e., values) of variables appearing in the majority (or even all) of the satisfying assignments are essential for CDCL SAT solving, and (2) it is sufficient to query the neural model only once for the predictions before the SAT solving starts.

Main Idea:
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of logical formulas. Building on this, we show that GNN- based SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long- range dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed- length representations.
